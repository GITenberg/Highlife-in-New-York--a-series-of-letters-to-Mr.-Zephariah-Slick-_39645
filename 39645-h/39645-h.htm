<p>A letter was dispatched to Weathersfield requesting Mr.
Slick to forward a preface for his volume of epistles, but
that gentleman instead sent the following letter, which is so
full of his own peculiar humor that his friends will no doubt
gladly accept of it in lieu of one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Publishers.</span><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weathersfield, Connecticut.</span><br /></p>

<p>Gentlemen, Surs:</p>

<p>Your letter got tu the old humstead last night, nigh upon
bed time, and it eenamost upsot me to think that a feller
that's printed so many smashing books, had got a notion tu
print my Letters tu, and asked my consent jest as mealy
mouthed as a feller asks the gal he's been a courting to yoke
in with him for life.</p>

<p>Now about the price of them are letters when they are
all fixed out in a book. I ain't much acquainted with that
sort of trading; but I reckon you'll have to go a notch
higher yit. I never yit heard of a Slick's taking the fust
offer for any thing, and I've cut my eye teeth as well as the
rest on 'em, if I du write. Say ten or fifteen dollars more
now, and mebby it'll du, providing you give in a set of them
are stories of the Revolution with picters, and some of the
smashing novels that have got your names tu them, for my
book-shelf in the back-room. Come up tu the mark on this
point, and I'll agree tu sign off any time you want me tu,
and I hope the book'll go off like a flash of lightning down
a forked rod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg <abbr title="4">iv</abbr>] </a></span></p><p>But you want me to write something with a pesky new
fangled name that has eenamost upsot me. Write a preface!
What on arth is a preface? I can pull an even yoke with
any York chap yet, at writing a letter; but when you come
to talk of prefaces, darn me if I know what the critters are.
Your letter kinder riled me up. The first thing I did was
to get down the old goose quill and ink-bottle and go to
work. I was a'most tuckered out a grinding cider all day,
but the thoughts of having my name on the kiver of a
smashing book with picters in it, sot my genius to working
like a yeast pot; but then how tu begin with this new-fangled
consarn&mdash;there it was agin. I got the old dictionary
and tried to find out what a preface was; but I might
as well have tried to make timber out of pine shavings.
"Something to go before a speech, or a book, or an essay,
to tell what they're about." Now if it had said an old hoss
leading off an ox-team with a cart behind, I could have sent
the animal at once, fresh and chirk from the cider mill;
but how to tackle an idea on a book and make it pull, is
more than I am up to, without knowing more about the sort
of literary animal you want to use, and the harness that fits
him. I ain't rusted out yit, by no manner of means; but I
don't mean to make a coot of myself by tackling in with any
strange animal till I know what he is. Now take a pen in
hand tu once and let me know what it is that you want, and
you can depend on me, fodder or no fodder; but keep dark
about my having to ask about it. I don't want all the
literary chaps in York a poking fun at me.</p>

<p>Wal, yes, I ain't ashamed to own it, I am tickled eenamost
tu death with the idee of my letters being printed in a
harnsome book with tip-top picters in it. But about my
likeness, taken for the <i>Morning Express</i> when I first come tu
York, with the corn-colored coat and pepper-and-salt trowsers
and old bell crown&mdash;gauly, how I sot by that old hat!
Wal, as I was saying about that are likeness, I han't no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg <abbr title="5">v</abbr>] </a></span>objections tu its going inside the kiver jest as it was. But
like all great literary characters, I reckon there's been a
pretty considerable improvement in me since I began to
write, and, like our old barn that's been shingled and clapboarded
over, I'm the same critter yet, timbers and all; but
I reckon you'll find that I've slicked up the outside a few,
and grown a little more pussy since the old pepper-and-salt
saw the day.</p>

<p>Now I'll tell you jest how you'd better manage it. Put
the picter you speak on inside the kiver; but on the outside
jest have me pictered out in a bran new hat, that Mr.
Genin sent me jest afore I left York. It's about as near
like the old one, as a son ought to be like his par. Don't
forget my velvet vest, finefied off with curlecues, and my
blue coat with the shining buttons; and if you don't git a
picter that'll make the gals' eyes water, your artists down
there in York don't know a good looking chap when they
see him, or can't paint him if they du.</p>

<p>Now about writing another book, I raly don't know what
tu say. Them letters of mine eenamost tuckered me out at
the time; but somehow I'd give all creation to be at 'em
again, and one of these days I may pluck up grit and take
a trip over tu England. If I du, by the living hokey, you'll
find John Bull in a tantrum by the time I've got through
with him. That are English lord that I writ about in my
letters, gave me an invite tu come tu England, and mebby
he'll see a good looking chap about my size on t'other side
the fishing pond some day or other. Who knows?</p>

<p>You want to know if I feel content to give up life among
the big bugs in New York, and settle down here in the
country. Wal, now, between you and I and the post, I du
feel a trifle melancholy now and then. Foddering cattle,
going tu mill and chopping ovenwood ain't jest the thing tu
rile up the poetry in a feller's bosom; and onion tops and
garden sars generally ain't considered the sort of greens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg <abbr title="6">vi</abbr>] </a></span>that a literary chap wants put round his head, though
they're awful refreshing to the stomach. But then again,
my par, the deacon, is getting to be a purty old man, and
Judy&mdash;&mdash;; but what's the use of talking arter a feller's
under the harrow?</p>

<p>Wal, if I ain't contented, I sartinly ought to be, if the
women folks are judges, and it's quite a considerable time
since I've thought it worth while to have a tussel for any
opinion of my own. But tu own right up, I du hanker
awfully tu get off into the world agin; but, for gracious
sake, don't say a word about it. I should never hear the
last of it, if you did, for Judy hates city gals like rank
pisin, and is allfired jealous that I'm hankering to git among
'em again.</p>

<p>I don't know how I ever cum to write this ere long letter,
but somehow, when I set down, pen in hand, the old natur
will bile up and run on.</p>

<p>Now about that are consarned preface, jest set down tu
once and describe the way it's to be done, and I'll undertake
it, for I want tu make the book first chop; and if you want
more team, I'm the chap tu hitch it on, the minit you let a
feller know what's wanted. So, hoping you'll be particular
about the preface,</p>

<p class="salutation">I'm yours tu command,</p>

<p class="JS">Jonathan Slick.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Don't forget to have my watch chain and things
a hanging outside of the vest, and put my two big rings
with stones in 'em, on my left hand. I say nothing, but
there may be gals in New York that would like tu see them
are rings agin, but take them off from all the kivers you
send into these parts now, I tell you.</p>

<p class="chaphead">First Impressions of New York&mdash;Visit to the Counting-room of a City
Cousin&mdash;Advice to his Clerk&mdash;Description of a City Residence and
its Inmates.</p>

<p>To Mr. Zepharia Slick, Justice of the Peace, and Deacon of the Church, over to
Weathersfield, in the State of Connecticut:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>I arrived here safe and sound, arter a long and tedious voyage
down the river and along shore to this place. The Captain left
me to navigate the sloop purty much alone. The lazy coot did
nothing on arth but eat raw turnips and drink cider brandy all
the way down. I'll be whipped if he warn't more than half
corned the hull time. Now it's my opinion that the best thing
you can do with that chap is to send him eend foremost about
his business jest as quick as he gits back. He don't arn salt to
his porrage, nor never did. The first thing I did arter the sloop
was hauled up to the wharf at Peck slip, was to go down to the
stores about Fulton market and peddle off the cider brandy and
garden sarce. Captain Doolittle wanted to go with me, but you
sent me down here as a sort of a supercargo, and I warn't likely
to let him stick his nose into my business.</p>

<p>By gracious, if it didn't make me stare to see the purty gals
and the harnsome married wimmen a walking up and down the
market among the heaps of beets and cabbages. They looked
around mighty knowing, and I rather guess I got my share of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14] </a></span>attention; but somehow it made me feel kinder streaked to have
them a looking at me so steady, for I hadn't nothing on but my
every day clothes, besides, the stock that marm made me out of
her old bombasine petticoat, propped up my chin so that I couldn't
a stooped to look into a woman's face if I'd a wanted tu ever so
much. I do believe marm and Judy White must a put more than
a peck of tatur starch into the lining. It's allfired stiff, that's a
fact.</p>

<p>Wal, I sold out the lading to purty good advantage, considering
the times. Then I went down to the sloop, and slicked up
in my Sunday clothes and started off full chisel to go and see
cousin John Beebe. They told me that he kept store away down
Pearl street, eenamost to the Battery; so I went on, as fast as I
could git along through the boxes and barrels that lay in the
street, till I come to a great high brick store that had cousin
John's name over the door. It seems that John has gone into
partnership with a Mr. Co, for that feller's name is on the sign
arter his'n as large as life. I knew that he and John Wheeler
went into company together, but I suppose they wanted more
chink than either on 'em could raise, and so engaged this Mr.
Co to help 'em along.</p>

<p>I swan if it warn't enough to make a feller dry to see the hogsheads
of rum and molasses, and the heaps of tea boxes and sugar
barrels, piled up inside the store; it looked like living, I can tell
you. I went through clear to the other eend of the store, for
they told me that cousin John was in the counting-room, away
back there.</p>

<p>Wal, I got into the counting-room at last, and a harnsome little
room it was, all carpeted and fixed out like some of our best rooms
in Connecticut. I hain't seen so purty a store scarce ever. John
wasn't there, but I could see that he hadn't got over all his old tricks,
for a lot of chestnut shells were trod down round the stove, and
there wasn't a few empty bottles standing round under the table
and back of the desks. It was enough to turn one's stomach to
look at the spit box; it was more than half filled up with pieces
of segars, and ends of tobacco, that looked as if they had been
chawed over a dozen times or more. I don't see where cousin
John got that trick of smoking and chawing; I defy any body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15] </a></span>to say he larned it in old Connecticut. They needn't talk to us
about the Yankees, for these Yorkers beat us all holler in them
things; I hain't forgot the time when John would a turned up
his nose at a long nine, as if it had a been pison, but now he's sot
himself up for a gentleman there is no knowing what he hain't
taken tu.</p>

<p>There was a chap standing by one of the desks, with the edge
of his dickey turned over his stock&mdash;like an old-fashioned baby's
bib, put on wrong side afore&mdash;and with his hair curled and frizzled
up like a gal's. I knew in a minit that this feller couldn't
be cousin John, so I went up to him, and sez I:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friend, can you tell me when Mr. Beebe 'ill be in?" The
chap took a watch out of his vest pocket about as big as a ninepence,
and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know positively, but I s'pose in the course of half an
hour or so. It's about time for the banks to close."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I s'pose I may as well wait for him, as I ain't
in much of a hurry jest now." So I sot down in a chair, and
arter histing my sole leather onto the top of the stove, I begun
to scrape acquaintance with the chap, as I went along.</p>

<p>"Tough times with you marchants, now, ain't they?" sez I, a
looking over the top of the paper.</p>

<p>"Very," sez he, a mending his pen. "It's as much as we can
du to make both eends meet afore the bank's shut up days. Mr.
Beebe's out a shinning now."</p>

<p>"A what?" sez I.</p>

<p>"A shinning," says he&mdash;"borrowing money to take up his
own notes with, and if he don't get it, I don't know what we
<em>shall du</em>."</p>

<p>"Oh!" sez I to myself, "this is the new partner, Mr. Co; he
must have a good chance of money in the consarn, or he wouldn't
feel so oneasy."</p>

<p>"We was doing a beautiful business," sez he, a shaking his
head, "till some of the banks stopped specie payments. I wish
they'd a been sunk."</p>

<p>"No," sez I, "that ain't fair, but it's human natur, I s'pose to
give banks as well as people, a helping kick when they're going
down hill. I don't understand much of these things, Mr. Co."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16] </a></span></p>
<p>"My name isn't Co," sez he, a staring; "it's Smith."</p>

<p>"What," sez I, "have they got another in the company?"</p>

<p>"No," sez he, kinder coloring up; "I'm the assistant bookkeeper."</p>

<p>I couldn't but jest keep from giving a long whistle right out,
the stuck up varmint! "Wal," sez I, arter a minit, "Mr.
Smith, let me give you one piece of advice&mdash;don't be so ready to
say <em>we</em>, and to talk over your employers' business with strangers
next time. Such things do no good any way, but they may do a
good deal of harm. It's the duty of a clark, among us, to attend
to that he's paid for, and if he attends to much else, we purty
ginerally find out that he ain't good for much in the long run."</p>

<p>You never saw a feller look so mean as he did when I said this;
he turned all manner of colors, and acted mad enough to eat me.
I didn't seem to mind him, but took up a newspaper and begun
to read, jest as if he wasn't in the room; and by-am-by I got so
deep in the paper, that I forgot all about him or cousin Beebe
either.</p>

<p>Look a-here, Par, if you hain't seen the New York <i>Evening
Express</i>, jest stretch your purse-strings a leetle, and subscribe for
it. It's a peeler of a paper, I can tell you. You needn't take my
word for it though, for I've made this letter so tarnal long, that
it'd cost more than the price of a paper a hull year to pay the
postage, so I've a notion to git the editors to print this for me in
their primest evening paper, and so you'll git my letters and paper
tu, all for five cents. I'll jest give you a little notion how they
make the <i>Express</i>, for I read it eenamost through, afore cousin
John come. The editors get all the papers in the country together,
jest as we pick out our apples in cider time, and they go
to work and git all that's worth reading out on 'em, and put it
all in one great paper, which they sell for two cents; so that a
feller can know what's said by every editor North and South, on
one side and t'other, without the trouble of reading but one paper;&mdash;jest
as we can git the juice of a bushel of apples all in a
pint of cider, after it's once been through the mill. I raly think
it's one of the best plans I ever heard on, and I'm so sartin that
every body will take it by-am-by, that I've a notion that if you'd
jest as livs let me throw up the onion trade, I'll try and get in to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17] </a></span>write for it, but we'll talk all that over by-am-by, arter I've seen
the editors. Major Jack Downing is writing for them already,
and perhaps&mdash;but I hain't made up my mind about it yit, though
I kept a thinking it over all the while I was a reading in the
counting-room.</p>

<p>Wal, I was jest taking a dive inter the advertisements, when
cousin John came in. I raly believe you wouldn't know the critter,
he's altered so. He's grown as fat and pussy as old lawyer
Sikes in our parts, but I raly think he looks better for it. I tell
you what, his clothes must cost him a few. He had on a superfine
broadcloth coat, that didn't cost a whit less than ten dollars
a yard, I wouldn't be afraid to bet a cookey. You could a seen
your face in his boots, and his hair was parted on the top of his
head, and hung down on the sides of his face and all over his
coat collar, till he looked more like a woman in men's clothes
than any thing else. I thought I should a haw-hawed out a larfin,
all I could du, though it made me kinder wrathy to see a
feller make such an etarnal coot of himself. I thought I'd see
if he'd know me agin, so I on'y jist crossed one foot over t'other
on the top of the stove, and tipt my chair back on its hind legs,
and kept on reading as independent as a corkscrew, jest ter see
how he'd act.</p>

<p>Wal, he cum right up to the stove, and took his coat tail under
his arms, and begun to whistle as if there warn't nobody in
the room. Once in a while as I took a peek over the top of the
paper, I could see that he was a looking at me kinder sideways,
as if he couldn't exactly make up his mind whether he knew me
or not. I felt my heart kinder rising up in my throat, for it put
me in mind of old times when we used to weed onions and slide
down hill together. At last I couldn't stand it no longer, so I
jumped up and flung down the paper, and, says I, "Cousin
Beebe, how do you du?"</p>

<p>He stared like a stuck pig at fust, but I raly believe the feller
was glad to see me when he found out who I was, for he shook
my hand like all natur. Sez he, "Mr. Slick," sez he, "I'm glad
to see you down in the city; how's the deacon, and aunt Eunice,
and the Mills gals? You see I han't forgot old times."</p>

<p>With that we sot into a stream of talk about Weathersfield people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18] </a></span>and so on that lasted a good two hours, by the town clock.
Arter a while cousin John took out his watch, all gold inside
and out, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Slick, it's about four o'clock&mdash;go up and take a
family dinner with us."</p>

<p>I rather guess I stared a few, to think of being axed to eat dinner
at that time o' day; but as I hadn't eat any thing but a cold
bite aboard the sloop since morning, the thoughts of a good
warm dinner warn't by no means to be sneezed at.</p>

<p>"Better late than never," sez I to myself, arter I had put on
my hat and stuck my hands in my pantaloons' pockets ready for
a start. But jest as we wur a going out, there come a feller in to
talk over some bisness matters, so sez Cousin Beebe, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, Mr. Slick, is the number of our house&mdash;supposin you
go along and tell Mrs. Beebe that I'll be home as soon as I can get
through a little bisness&mdash;she wont make a stranger of you."</p>

<p>"I rather guess she won't," sez I, a taking the little piece of
paper which he'd been a writing on; "if she does there must a
been an almighty change in her since we used to go to singing
school and apple bees together."</p>

<p>John looked kind a skeery toward the stranger, and begun to
fidget about; so I told him I could find the way and made myself
scarce in less than no time&mdash;for I thought as like as not the
feller cum to git him to put his name to a note, or something of
that sort; so I thought I'd give him a chance to say no, if he
wanted tu.</p>

<p>By gracious! Par, I'd give a quart of soap if you and marm
could a been with me in Broadway as I went along. I couldn't
help stopping eenamost every other minit to look into the
winders.</p>

<p>Some of them was chuck full of watches and ear-rings, and
silver spoons spread all out like a fan, and lots on lots of finger
rings all stuck over a piece of black cloth to make 'em shine.
I'll be darned if it didn't make my eyes ache as if I'd been snow
blind a week, only jest to look at 'em as I went along! I stopped
into one store jest by the Park, and bought a silver thimble for
marm, and it was as much as I could du to keep from going into
one of the stores where I saw such a heap of calicos, to git her a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19] </a></span>new gown tu. But I can't begin to write more than a priming
of what a feller may see as he goes up Broadway. It fairly made
me ashamed of our horses, old Polly in perticlar, when I saw
the harnsome critters that the niggers drive about them coaches
with here. I tell you what, they make a glistening and a shining
when they go through the streets chuck full of gals all in
their feathers and furbelows! That Broadway <em>is</em> a leetle lengthy,
and no mistake. I believe I footed it more than two miles on
them tarnal hard stun walks, afore I got to Bond street, where
Cousin Beebe lives, I swan! I thought my feet would a
blistered.</p>

<p>Wal, arter all, I thought I never should a got into the house
when I did git to it. It was so allfired high, and a heap of stun
steps went up to the door, with a kind of picket fence made out
of iron, all <em>curlecued</em> over on the sides. I looked all over the
door for a knocker, but couldn't find nothing in the shape of one,
only a square chunk of silver, with cousin Beebe's name writ on
it. I rapped with my fist till the skin eenamost peeled off my
knuckles, but nobody seemed to hear, and I begun to think the
folks warn't to hum, and that I should lose my dinner arter all.
I was jest beginning to think it best to make tracks for Peck
slip agin, when a feller come by and kinder slacked tackle, and
looked as if he was a going to speak.</p>

<p>"Look a here, you, sir," sez I, "can you tell me whether the
folks that live here are to hum or not? I can't make nobody
hear."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ring the bell?" sez he, a looking at me as if
he never see a man afore.</p>

<p>I went down the steps and looked up to the ruff of the house,
but it was so darned high that I couldn't a seen anything in the
shape of a belfry if there'd been a dozen on 'em.</p>

<p>"I'll be darned if I can see any bell," sez I to the man, and
then he kinder puckered up his mouth, and looked as if he was
a going to larf right out.</p>

<p>"You seem to be a stranger in the city," sez he, a trying to
bite in, for I s'pose he see that my dander was a gitting up.</p>

<p>"Yes," sez I, "I am, and what of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," sez he, a hauling in his horns quite a considerable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20] </a></span>"Jest pull that little silver knob there, and I rather think
you can make them hear."</p>

<p>With that I went up the steps agin, and give the knob, as he
called it, an almighty jerk, for I felt a little riled about being
larfed at. It warn't half a jiffy afore the door was opened, and
a great strapping nigger stood inside, staring at me as if he
meant to swaller me hull, without vinegar or gravy sarce.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "you snowball you, what are you staring at?
Why don't you git out of the way and let me cum in?"</p>

<p>"Who do you want?" sez he, without so much as moving an
inch&mdash;the impudent varmint.</p>

<p>"What's that to you, you darned lump of charcoal?" sez I;
"jest you mind your own bisness and git out of the door."
With that I give him a shove and went into the entry-way.
When the nigger had picked himself up agin, I told him to go
and tell Miss Beebe that her cousin Jonathan Slick, from Weathersfield,
Connecticut, wanted to see her.</p>

<p>I wish you could a seen how the feller showed the whites of
his eyes when I said this. I couldn't keep from larfin to see him
a bowing and scraping to me.</p>

<p>"Jest step into the drawing-room," sez he, a opening a door;
"I will tell Miss Beebe that you are here."</p>

<p>By the living hokey! I never stepped my foot in such a room
as that in all my born days. I raly thought my boot was a sinking
inter the floor, the carpet was so thick and soft. It seemed
jest like walking over the onion patches, when they've jest been
raked and planted in the spring time. The winder curtains were
all yaller silk with a great heap of blue tossels hanging round the
edges, and there was no eend to the little square benches, about
as big as marm's milking stool, all kivered over with lambs and
rabbits a sleeping among lots of flowers, as nat'ral as life. The
backs of the chairs were solid mahogany or cherry-tree wood, or
something like it, and they were kinder rounded off and curled
in like a butter scoop turned handle downward. Then there
were two chairs, all stuffed and kivered with shiney black cloth,
with a great long rocker a poking out behind, and on the mantle
shelf was something that I couldn't make out the use on&mdash;it was
a heap of stuff that looked like gold, with a woman, all kivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21] </a></span>over with something that made her shine like a gilt button,
lying on the top. I wanted to finger it awfully, but there was a
glass thing put over it, and I couldn't; but I hadn't pecked
about long afore I found out that it was one of these new-fashioned
clocks that we've heard about; but it's no more like
them clocks that our Samuel peddles, than chalk is like cheese.</p>

<p>There were two other things, kinder like the clock, on both
eends of the mantle shelf, but they warn't nigh so big, and they
hadn't no pointers nor no woman on the top, and instead of the
glass kiver there was long chunks o' glass hanging down all
round them, like icicles round the nose of our pump in the
winter time. I give one on 'em a little lift jest to find out what
it was, but the glasses begun to gingle so that it scared me out
of a year's growth, and I sot down agin mighty quick, I can
tell you.</p>

<p>Wal, arter a while I begun to grow fidgety, so I sot down on
a settee all kivered over with shiney cloth like the chairs, but I
guess I hopped up agin spry enough. I never saw anything giv
as the seat did, I thought at first that I was a sinking clear
through to the floor, clothes and all. It makes me fidgety to be
shut up in a room alone, so I begun to fix a little; but all I could
du, them new cassimere pantaloons, that Judy White made for
me, would keep a slipping up eenamost to the top of my boots.
I don't see how on arth the chaps in New York keep their trousers'
legs down so slick; one would think they had been dipped
into 'em as marm makes her taller candles, they fit so.</p>

<p>Wal, arter I'd worked long enough on the tarnal things, I went
up to a whapper of a looking-glass, that reached eenamost from
the top to the bottom o' the room, and jest took a peep at a chap
about my size on t'other side. I tell you what it is, the feller
there warn't to be sneezed at on a rainy day, if he did cum from
the country; though for a sixfooter he looked mighty small in
that big looking-glass. I guess you'd a larfed to a seen him trying
to coax his dickey to curl over the edge of that plaguey stiff
bombazine stock that marm made, and to a seen him a pulling
down them narrer short risbands so as to make them stick out
under his cuff, and a slicking down his hair on each side of his
face with both hands; but it wouldn't stay though. Nothing on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22] </a></span>arth but a hog is so contrary as a feller's hair, when it once gits
to sticking up, I du think.</p>

<p>I'd fixed up purty smart, considering, and was jest sticking my
breast-pin a leetle more in sight, when the door opened and
cousin Mary come in. If I hadn't expected it was her, I'm sartin
I shouldn't a known her no more than nothing, she was so
puckered up. She had on a silk frock ruffled round the bottom,
and her hair hung in great long black curls down her neck, eenamost
to her bosom, and she had a gold chain wound all round
her head, besides one a hanging about her neck, and her waist
warn't bigger round than a pint cup. I never was so struck up
in my life, as I was tu see her. Instid of coming up and giving
me a good shake o' the hand or a buss&mdash;there wouldn't a been
any harm in't as we were cousins&mdash;she put one foot for'ard a
little and drew t' other back kind o' catecornering, and then she
sort o' wriggled her shoulders, and bent for'ard and made a
curchy, city fashion. Sez I tu myself, "If that's what you're up
tu, I'll jest show you that we've had a dancing school in Weathersfield
since you left it, Miss Beebe." So I put out my right
foot and drew it up into the holler of t'other foot, and let my
arms drop down a sort a parpindicular, and bent for'ard&mdash;jest as
a feller shuts a jack knife when he's afeard of cutting his fingers&mdash;and
keeping my eyes fixed on her face, though I did have to
roll 'em up a leetle&mdash;I reckon I give her a purty respectable
sample of a Weathersfield bow to match her York curches.</p>

<p>"Pray be seated, Mr. Slick," sez she, a screwing her mouth up
into a sort of a smile; but when I saw how she was stuck up I
warn't a-going to be behind hand with her, so I puckered up my
mouth tu, though it was awful hard work, and sez I, "arter you
is manners for me, Miss Beebe."</p>

<p>With that she sot down in one of the rocking-chairs and stuck
her elbow on her arm and let her head drop into her hand as if
she warn't more than half alive, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take an ottoman, Mr. Slick."</p>

<p>I guess I turned red enough, for I hadn't no idee what she
ment, but I sot down on one of the foot-stools at a ventur, and

<p>"How do Mr. and Mrs. Slick du? I hope they're well."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23] </a></span></p>

<p>"Your uncle and aunt are purty smart, so as to be jogging
about, thank you, Miss Beebe." I hadn't but jest got the words
out of my mouth when there was a bell rung so as to make me
jump up, and in a minit arter cousin John come in.</p>

<p class="chaphead">The Family Dinner and Effects of July Cider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>"Wal, I see you've found the way, cousin Slick," sez he.
"Mary, my dear, is dinner ready?"</p>

<p>She hadn't time to speak before two great doors slid into the
partition, and there was another room jest as much like the one
we was in, as two peas in a pod. A table was sot in the middle
of the room, all kivered with rale China dishes, and first rate
glass tumblers, and a silver thing to set the pepper box in&mdash;you
hain't no idee how stilish it was. But as true as you live, there
stood that etarnal nigger, close by the table, as large as life. I
didn't know what to make on it, but sez I to myself, if cousin
John's got to be an abolitionist and expects me to eat with a
nigger, he'll find himself mistaken, I'll be darned to darnation
if he don't! But I needn't a got so wrathy; the critter didn't
offer to set down, he only stood there to git anything that we
wanted.</p>

<p>"Do you take verminsilly, Mr. Slick?" says Miss Beebe, biting
off her words as it she was afraid they'd burn her. With that
she took the kiver off one of the dishes, and begun to ladle out
some soup with a great silver dipper as bright as a new fifty
cent piece.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," says I, "but I'll take some of that are soup
instead, if you've no objection." The critter was jest beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24] </a></span>to pucker up her mouth again, as if she'd found out something
to poke fun at, but cousin John looked at her so etarnal cross
that she was glad to choke in. I s'pose cousin John see that I
felt dreadful oneasy, so he said, kind a coaxing,</p>

<p>"She meant verminsilly soup, cousin Slick. Let her help you
to some, I'm sartin you'll like it."</p>

<p>"Wal," says I, "I don't care if I du." So I took up a queer
looking spoon that lay by my plate, and tried to eat, but all I
could du, the soup would keep a running through the spoon into
the dish agin. I tried and tried to git one good mouthful, but I
might jest as well have detarmined to dip up the Connecticut
river in a sieve, and the most I could git was two or three
sprangles of little white things that I stirred up from the bottom
of the plate, that didn't taste bad, but to save my life I couldn't
make out what they were made out on. Arter I'd been a fishing
and diving ever so long, a trying to git one good spoonful, so that I
could tell what it was, I looked up, and there was the nigger
showing his teeth, and rolling about his eyes, like a black cat in
the dark. It made me wrathy, for I surmized that he was a
larfing to see me a working so hard to git a mouthful of something
to eat. I couldn't hold in any longer, so I jumped up and
flung down the spoon upon the floor, as spiteful as could be, and
sez I to the nigger, sez I,</p>

<p>"What do you stand a grinning at there, woolly head? go and
git me a spoon that hain't got no slits in it, I'd as lief eat with a
rake as that are thing."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, haw," larfed out the etarnal black varmint, "I
thought you would not make the fork hold."</p>

<p>With that Miss Beebe giggled right out, and cousin John
looked as if he would a burst to keep from larfing too.</p>

<p>"Stop your noise, sir," says he to the nigger, "pick up the
fork, and give Mr. Slick a spoon."</p>

<p>I begun to feel awful streaked, I can tell you; but I sot down
agin, and took up the real spoon, which lay on a kind of towel
folded up by my plate, and I begun to eat, without saying a
word, though I'd gin a silver dollar if they would a let me got
up and licked the nigger.</p>

<p>Wal, arter I'd got a good mouthful of the soup, I couldn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25] </a></span>make out what it was made of, for I couldn't remember of ever
seeing the name Miss Beebe called it by, in the dictionary.
Maybe it's Latin, says I, to myself, and then I tried to think over
what it could mean, and if nobody had told me what the definition
was in the Latin school which you sent me tu there in
Weathersfield. Verminsilly! Verminsilly! Verminsilly! kept
a running through my head all the time. I knew what silly
meant well enough, and then it popped into my head, all at
once, that <em>vermin</em> comes from the Latin <em>vermis</em>, which means
worms. Worm soup! my gracious, the very idee of it made
me feel awful bad at the stomach! But I might have known it
by the looks, and I should if I'd ever heard of sich a thing, for
the little slim critters swimming round in the liquor, looked as
much like angle-worms biled down white as could be. Arter I
found out what it was made of, I rather guess they didn't catch
me a eating any more of their verminsilly soup; so I pushed it
away half across the table, and wiped my mouth purty considerably
with my pocket handkercher. The nigger took the whole
on't away, and I declare I was glad enough to get rid of it.</p>

<p>"What on arth have they put this towel here for?" says I to
myself; and then I stole a sly look over to cousin Beebe, to see
if he'd got one, or if they only gave towels to company. Cousin
John had one jest like mine, but he'd spread it out on his lap,
so I jest took up mine and kivered over my cashmeres with it
tu.</p>

<p>Considering there was no onions on the table, I made out a
purty fair dinner. I was a beginning to think about moving
when the nigger brought a lot of blue glass bowls about half full
of water, and sot one down by each of us. What they could be
for I hadn't the least notion, but I kept a bright look out to see
what cousin John did, and when I saw him dip his fingers into
his bowl and wipe 'em on a sort of red towel which the nigger
brought along with the bowls, I jest went over the man&oelig;uvre
as natural as life.</p>

<p>Wal, while we were talking about the banks, and old times,
and Weathersfield folks dying off so, that coot of a nigger cleared
the table right off as slick as a whistle, and afore I hardly knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26] </a></span>what the fellow was up tu he come along and sot down a set of
decanters, and two cider bottles with the necks all covered over
with sheet lead, and then he brought two baskets made out of
silver, one on 'em was filled chuck full of oranges, and t'other
was heaped up with great purple grapes; I declare it eenamost
made my mouth water to see the great bunches a hanging over
the edge of the basket. I'd jest put a whopper of a bunch on
the little Chena plate which the feller set for me, and was considering
whether it would be genteel to cut the grapes in tu with
the cunning little silver knife which was put by the plate, when
all tu once, pop went something, eenamost as loud as a pistol,
close by me. I jumped up about the quickest, I can tell you;
but it was only the nigger a opening one of the cider bottles; he
poured out some for me in a great long glass with a spindle neck,
and I drunk it all at a couple of swallers, without stopping to
breath. By jingo! but it was capital cider! arter I'd drunk one
glass I begun tu feel as spry as a cricket.</p>

<p>"Here, snowball," says I, "give us another; these glasses are
awful small; now, I like to drink cider out of a pint mug."</p>

<p>"Take care," says cousin Beebe, "I'm afeard you'll find the
cider, as you call it, rather apt to get into your head."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," sez I, "I can stand a quart any day. Here,
cousin Mary, take another glass, you hain't forgot old times have
you? though I s'pose they don't have applecuts and quiltings
here in York, du they?"</p>

<p>I don't remember what she said, but I know this, my eyes begun
to grow allfired bright, and afore I got up tu go hum that
nigger must have put more than twenty baskets of grapes on the
table, and the oranges seemed to grow bigger and bigger every
minit, and I know there wur more than three times as many
glasses and decanters on the table, as there was at fust.</p>

<p>I ruther think it was purty nigh tea time when I got up to go
back to the sloop agin. I insisted on giving cousin Mary a buss
afore I went; and I won't be sartin, but I kinder seem to remember
shaking hands with the nigger, consarn him, jest afore I went
down the steps.</p>

<p>I don't feel very bright this morning, and I begin to think that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27] </a></span>maybe I shall come back to Weathersfield arter all. The York
cider don't seem to agree with me. I've felt dredful peaked ever
since I drunk it, and kinder hum sick tu boot.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan visits the Express Office&mdash;Sensations on seeing himself in
print.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Since I wrote my last letter there's been no eend to the things
that I've had to du. Arter thinking about it eenamost two
nights, I about made up my mind tu settle down here in York
a spell, and send you a grist of letters now and then, which I
mean to git printed in the New York Express, the way I told
you of.</p>

<p>I've been up to see the editors, and they want me to stay properly,
and I don't think I shall ever git so good a chance to take
up this literary way of gitting a living, as they call it, if I don't
snap at this offer tu once.</p>

<p>I thought at first that I'd try some other newspaper, and see
if I could git a higher bid, but somehow I'd taken a shine to the
Express, and thought it wasn't worth while. It warn't because
there wasn't papers enough, for you can't step three steps here
in York, without stumbling over a little stuck up newspaper
office. Besides, there's no eend to the papers carried round in
the streets. You can't go any where but some little dirty shaver
or other, about knee high to a toad, will stick a paper out under
your nose, and ask you to buy it, as crank as can be. Somehow,
it kinder seemed to me that the New York Express took the shine
off the papers that I'd seen among 'em all, though they was as
thick as toads arter a rain storm. I had a notion to write for it
from the first, because, think sez I, that prime feller, Major Jack
Downing, writes a good deal for it, and I rather think we shall
hitch tackle like any thing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28] </a></span></p>
<p>Wal, jest as soon as I made up my mind about it, I went right
off, full chisel, to the Express Office. I'd been round there once
afore to put my t'other letter into the Post Office, and so the
minit I come to the corner of Wall and Nassau Street, and saw
a house with the "New York Express Office" writ on the eend,
I knew it was the office without asking. So I crossed over, and
kinder hung about a leetle, jest to make my heart stop a beating
so, afore I went in. I swanny if I ever felt so in my life! I
was so anxious about that long letter that I sent to them to get
printed for you, that I was dreadful loth to go in, and eenamost
made up my mind to turn about and make tracks for the sloop
agin!</p>

<p>Wal, sez I to myself, it won't do any hurt jest to take a look
about the premises afore I go. A feller can find out a good deal
about a man's natur, by the looks of things about the place he
lives in; so I drew up before a board, all stuck over with picters,
and pieces of old newspaper, by the eend of the building, and
putting my hands in my pockets, I stood still, and looked up'ards
to see what I could make out. But instid of taking an observation
of the premises, I begun to think about the cattle and the
spring shotes that Judy White used to take sich care on, till the
tears eenamost cum into my eyes, I was so humsick.</p>

<p>Wal, I was standing there on the stun walk, with both hands
buried considerable deep in my trousers' pockets, a looking up at
the sign writ out on the eend of the office, when a feller cum up
and begun to read the pieces of paper stuck on the board jest
outside. So I wiped the tarnal tears away with the cuff of my
coat, for it made me feel kinder cheap to have anybody see a fellow
of my size boo-hooing in York streets because he happened to
think about hum and old times; and I got up a leetle grit, and
went right straight down into the office, for it's half under
ground. A chap that sot back of a sort of counter, where there
was a lot of papers folded up, lifted his head once, and went to
writing agin as if I warn't nobody.</p>

<p>"Do you print the Evening Express here?" sez I kinder low,
for I felt so dreadful anxious about the letter, that I was eenamost
choked.</p>

<p>"Yes" sez he, a gitting up, "do you want one?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29] </a></span></p>

<p>"Wal, I don't care if I take one," sez I, a forking out a four-pence-halfpenny
from my trousers' pocket. "Anything particular&mdash;that
is purty smart in it to-day?"</p>

<p>"Nothing <em>very</em> remarkable to-day," sez he, "but if you call
to-morrow we shall print a capital letter from one Mr. Jonathan
Slick of Weathersfield."</p>

<p>I swanny if my heart didn't jump like a rabbit at the sight of
a piece of sweet apple in snow time! "You don't say so," sez
I, and I tried not to look tickled all I could, but somehow my
mouth wouldn't stay still; and I hain't the least dout but that
I kept grinning in the feller's face, jest like a monkey over a hot
chesnut. It was as much as I could du to keep from jumping
over the counter and hugging him, I was so allfired glad.</p>

<p>He didn't seem to mind, but sot down and begun to write agin
as if nothing was the matter, and so I took up the paper and
went off; but, I ruther guess I stepped high, for I kept thinking
what you and marm and Judy White would say when you saw
yourselves all in print as large as life.</p>

<p>When I went out, there stood the chap a reading the pieces of
newspapers yit. I wanted to go up and shake hands with him
and tell him all about it, I was so full of what the chap inside
said about my letter, but I didn't though. I went down to the
sloop, and I wanted to tell Captain Doolittle about it. But, sez
I to myself, I'll choke in to-day, but if his eyes don't stick out
to-morrow I'll lose my guess.</p>

<p>I ruther think that I didn't let the grass grow under my feet,
when Thursday cum, but up I went at the Express Office like a
house a-fire. It raly seem'd as if my heart would bust, I was so
dreadful anxious to see the paper. I didn't stop to ketch breath
but went right into the office, and there sot a couple of fellers
that looked as stiff and knowing as could be, back of the counter.
Sez I to myself, I guess I've found the editors this time anyhow.</p>

<p>"I want to get five papers right off," says I (laying a quarter
o'dollar on the counter); with that one of the editors got up, as
mealy-mouthed as could be, and he put the quarter back in my
hands&mdash;sez he,</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, we shan't take money from <em>you</em>; here are the
papers&mdash;come, take a seat back of the counter here&mdash;we want
to have a little talk with you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30] </a></span></p>
<p>Wal, I went back, and the tallest of the two chaps got up, and
gin me his chair, and says he, "Mr. Slick, we've printed your
letter, and should like to have some more on 'em."</p>

<p>I hitched a little in my chair, and sez I, "Wal, if we can agree
about the price, I don't care if I send you a few more now and
then."</p>

<p>"What subjects do you mean to take up, Mr. Slick?" says the
shortest one.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I hain't made up my mind yit, but I reckon
a'most anything that turns up."</p>

<p>"Supposing you try politics," sez the tall feller. "Major Jack
Downing has done purty well in that line. The 'lection comes
on soon, and it'll be a good time for you to begin."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I'll go about a little, and see how I like it."</p>

<p>"That's settled, then," sez t'other. "Now, Mr. Slick, if we
ain't making too bold, I should like to know how long you have
been in New York?"</p>

<p>I kinder larfed in my sleeve to hear the sly coot try to come
round, and find out who I was and all about me. Sez I to myself,
I ain't quite sartin about the tall chap there, but I'll be blamed
if you've the least bit of Yankee in you. Now a feller of rale
ginuine grit would cum up to the mark tu once, and would a jest
asked a feller right out who he was, and where he cum from, and
how much he was worth, and how much he owed, besides some
cute questions about his wife and children, if he wanted tu.
Wal, thinks I, the man hain't been brought up to these things,
and he ain't to be blamed for not knowing how. So I put one
leg over t'other, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Wal, gentlemen, it ain't of no use to go circumventing round
the subject, as old Deacon Miles used to in his exhortations,
that had neither eend, middle, or beginning. So I'll jest up and
tell right out who I am, and what I mean to du.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you've heard of Samuel Slick, that feller that wrote
that tarnal smart book about Canada, wooden clocks, and matters
and things in gineral?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31] </a></span></p>
<p>"<em>Sam</em> Slick, you mean," sez the tall editor.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," sez I, setting up straight; "he was baptized
Samuel in the old Presbyterian Meeting-house in Weathersfield,
and nobody but the newspaper chaps ever thought of calling him
Sam. It's too bad this notion of cutting off the latter eend of a
feller's name; it's a whittling things down a leetle too close, and
looks as if a feller's father was so awful poor, that he couldn't
afford to give a hull name to his posterity. Wal, Samuel Slick,
Esquire, is my own natral born brother&mdash;I hain't no idee of bragging
about my relation, because it's my notion that in a free
country every feller ought to cut his own fodder; but when a
man's relations is getting up in the world, it's of no use to be
mealy-mouthed about owning 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes," says the tall chap. "Mr. Samuel Slick is a relation
which any man might be proud to own."</p>

<p>I larfed a little. "Sartinly," sez I, "Samuel has contrived to
come his 'soft sodder' over you newspaper chaps about the nicest.
I've a notion, too, that they'll find out that I haint much behind
hand with him; but I mean to write something about my life in
Weathersfield one of these days, and send it to you to print.</p>

<p>"Now, I tell you what it is, I've a notion to hire an office
somewhere down in Cherry street, and if you'll print my letters,
why, I reckon I can make out to get a living out of these Yorkers,
by hook or by crook. I mean to du things above board, and in
an independent way, jest to see how the experiment 'ill work,
but if I find that it won't do, I'll take up Samuel's plan, and go
the soft sodder principle; his mode 'ill work tarnation well, and
if they don't find Jonathan Slick, your most obedient servant to
command, a chip from the same block, I'll lose my guess, that's
all!"</p>

<p>When I said this, I got up and put on my hat, and then I happened
to think about the fourpence halfpenny, and I turned to
the chap that sot writing, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a here! I believe I forgot to take change for fourpence
t'other day. I'll take that three cents now, if you've no objection."
The feller handed over the three coppers, and I pocketed
'em as I went out of doors. "A penny saved is worth two
arned," says I to myself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32] </a></span></p>
<p>The very minit I got into the street, I couldn't hold in any
longer. So I jest stopped on the walk by the Post-office and
opened one of the papers. By the living hokey! if the first
thing I see wasn't a picter of my own self, as large as life and
twice as nat'ral, a standing up on the top of the paper as crank
as could be. There was the Express office jest as it was when
I fust see it. I swan! if I didn't haw-haw right out loud in the
street! Down I went to the sloop, about the quickest, and I up
and told Captain Doolittle all about it. I thought the tarnal
critter would a gone off the handle, he larfed so when he saw
how nat'ral the picter looked; but he larfed on t'other side of
his mouth, I reckon, when he read what I'd said about him in
the letter. He got awful wrathy, but I only sot still and took it
as if nothing had been the matter.</p>

<p>"Look a here, Captain Doolittle," sez I, "aint Editors and
Lawyers always abusing one another in print? Don't they call
each other all kinds o' names, and then don't they shake hands
and come soft sodder over each other when they come face to
face? If you have the honor of going about with a man that
writes for the newspapers, you must be an etarnal coot if you git
mad because he prints that you love cider-brandy and eat raw
turnips. I can tell you what, you wouldn't find many newspaper
chaps that'd stick to the truth as close as I did. So jest
haul in your horns, and I'll write a private letter to Par, and tell
him all I said about you was 'poetical license,' as the editors call
it when they've told a whopper, or a leetle too much truth&mdash;for
one's as bad as t'other now-a-days."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, "if you'll du that, I'll make up; yit it's allfired
hard. But I say, Jonathan, you'll stand treat, won't you?"</p>

<p>I felt sorry for the critter, and so I went to a grocery with
him, and I guess the long nines and the New England rum that
I called for sot all things tu rights in less than no time.</p>

<p class="chaphead">The Political Meeting and its Disasters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Wal, a few nights ago, I thought I'd try one of them political
meetings the Editor's wanted me to attend and see how they
carried on there. So Captain Doolittle and I went to one of the
great halls hired for caucuses and crowded in by degrees, for the
hull building was jammed full of human live stock long afore we
got there. Arter a good deal of scuffling, we got up by one of
the winders where we could see purty much all that was going
on. I never in all my born days saw such a lot of horned cattle
together. Some on 'em was barefooted, and a good many hadn't
more than a coat and a pair of trousers among four or five on
'em. One feller close by me had the rim of his hat ripped off
till it hung down on his shoulders: the top was stove in, and he
had a black eye, besides another that wouldn't see straight.
"Look a here," sez he, to me, "why don't you shout when we
du?"</p>

<p>"Because I aint a mind tu," sez I; "how are you going to
help yourself?" Jest then a leetle pussy lawyer cum a crowding
through the gang, and at the sight of him they all sot up a noise
that made my hair stand on eend.</p>

<p>I never heard anything like it; they yelled and hollered enough
to split the ruff of the house. The chunked feller, with his hat
knocked into the middle of next week, poked about with his
elbows till he got room to draw his fiddle bow across a rickety
fiddle, that had two of the strings broke off and was cracked
from eend to eend. Squeak, squeak, went the fiddle close to my
ear, like a pig when he's being yoked. With that, a lot of fellers,
some with their coat tails tore off, and some with their trousers
held up with a piece of list instead of galluses, and every one on
'em as ragged as year old colts, begun to dance up and down the
room, but such double shuffles and pigeon wings was enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34] </a></span>make a feller die a larfin. Our old white cow used to dance
twice as well when she got into one of her tantrums. "Hurra
for our side! hurra! hurra!" yelled out a tall feller close by the
fiddler, with a mouth that twisted one way and his nose curling
off on t'other side, as if they hated each other like cats and dogs;
and with that he took off his old straw hat and shied it off into
the middle of the dancers. It lodged on the top of a feller's
head that was jest then trying to cut a pigeon wing over one of
the benches.</p>

<p>"Helloa, you feller you, jest toss back that hat, will you?"
sung out the tall feller, a pitching for'ard head over heels arter
his hat.</p>

<p>"No I wont, I'll be rumbusticated if I du;" sez the t'other
chap, a pushing toward the door, holding the hat down with
both hands, as if he warn't used to them kind o' things; "all
fair in 'lection time. Hurra for equal rights!"</p>

<p>Jest then there cum in a grist of fellers a yelling and a kicking
up their heels like all possessed. They'd brought in some more
'lection news.</p>

<p>"Who on arth can these critters be?" sez I to Captin
Doolittle.</p>

<p>"Oh that's a squad of Irishmen; don't you see how the hair's
all worn off their heads a carrying brick hods on 'em?" says the
Captin.</p>

<p>"You don't say so; now by gracious how they du blather out
their words, dont they?" sez I, but I might as well a been talking
to a stun fence, for jest that minit the hull on 'em sot up a
noise that was enough to make a feller's eye teeth jump out of
his head.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear four hundred thousand wild cats, and bears,
and wolves, and screech owls, a squalling, and a howling, and a
squeaking together? If you haint, there's no use trying to make
you have the least idee how that etarnal crowd of critters did
hoot and yell. There they were a screaming, and a stamping, and
a dancing, and a fiddling, all in a heap, till a feller couldn't hear
himself think, and wouldn't a known what he was thinking
about if he did hear.</p>

<p>Now says a leetle man by the winder, clear your pipes, feller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35] </a></span>citizens; let's give 'em a song. I've got one printed off here so
that you can all jine in. Them that can't read or don't know
the tune can sing Yankee Doodle or Hail Columbia.</p>

<p>With that he flung a hull grist of papers among the crowd
and begun tu raise his ebenezer rather strong afore the rest sot
in. By-am-by they all got a going, and the way they roared out
the song was awful, I can tell you. Some of 'em sung in one
tune and some in another&mdash;every man went on his own hook.
The pussy little feller pulled away on the fiddle like all natur,
and the chap with the skewed nose made a plaguey squeaking
with a split fife that he had. The feller that hadn't no crown in
his hat bellered out Auld Lang Syne, and I see another chap
holding his paper upside down, and blowing away at Old Hundred
like all natur. When they begun to drop off, for it warn't
to be expected that sich a heap of critters could stop all together,
the pussy feller with the fiddle yelled out, "Hurra for the song!&mdash;Three
cheers for singing!" And then they went at it agin, a
hooting and tossing up their hats&mdash;them that had 'em&mdash;as if Old
Nick himself had kicked 'em on eend. By gracious! I don't
believe such a lot of white Injuns ever got together before, or
ever will agin. There was one great feller, as pussy as a bag of
bran in harvest time, that roared out his words like a hog that
had been larned to talk.</p>

<p>"That's a Yorkshireman," sez Captin Doolittle, "I'll treat if
it aint."</p>

<p>"Wal, who on arth is that feller there a talking to that little
stuck up chap with the peaked nose? What in the name of
natur does he mean by his <em>spracks</em> and his <em>yaws?</em> If I was the
little feller, I'd jest thank him not to bark in my face that way;
he opens his mouth as if he was a going to swaller the poor
critter hull, every time he speaks&mdash;du tell, who can he be,
Captin?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez the Captin, "I don't know sartin, but I ruther
guess he's one of them Dutch fellers, by his lingo."</p>

<p>"There, now, look a there," sez I, a pinting to a feller that
had jest come up to the Dutch chap. He wasn't over clean,
anyhow, but he had a great brass handkercher-pin stuck in his
bosom, and he strutted so that a common chap couldn't a touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36] </a></span>him with a ten foot pole. I poked my elbows into Captin Doolittle's
ribs, to try and make him tell me what he was; but he was
a looking t'other way, and wouldn't mind me. By-am-by the feller
begun to talk to the Dutch chap. He kept a flinging his
arms about every which way, and a jabbering over a mess of
lingo that was enough to make a man larf in his face. The
words all run together like marm's curd when the cheese gets
contrary and wont set. The Dutch feller kept a opening his
mouth, and once in a while a word would come out full chunk
right in t'other's face. Think sez I, if this aint a touch of the
dead languages, it ought to be, that's all&mdash;for it's enough to
make a feller die right off to hear it. He seemed to be ashamed
of himself at last, and begun to try to talk genuine American,
but he made awful work on't. By-am-by I found out that he
was a Frenchman; for a tall laathy feller, that I'd a took my
Bible oath cum straight off the Green Mountains, went up to
him, sort o' wrathy, and sez he, "Hold your yop, you tarnal
Frenchman; if you don't like this country and what we're a
doing, you'd better go back hum agin. I haint no doubt but
you can git enough frog soup without coming here to run us
down."</p>

<p>The French feller turned as red as a turkey's topping, and he
began to sputter away as mad as he could be. But t'other chap
jest put his hands in his pockets and sez he&mdash;"you go to grass."
I don't know what else he said, for that minit they all sot up one
of their almighty roars and yelled out&mdash;"a speech, a speech."
Then a feller with spectacles on, got up to make a speech, and
arter rolling up his shirt sleeves and spitting on his hands as if
he was going to chopping wood, he went at it shovel and tongs.</p>

<p>I'll be darned to darnation if it didn't make my blood bile to
hear how he went on. Sich a stream o' talk I never did hear
cum from one human critter. At last I got so wrathy that I
couldn't stand it no longer, and bust right out the minit he'd
got through.</p>

<p>"Feller citizens of New York," sez I, a mounting myself on
the winder sill, and sticking my right arm out as stiff as a crowbar,
"I aint much used to public speaking, but I must say a few
words."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37] </a></span></p>
<p>"Hurra for the Yankee&mdash;go it green horn&mdash;tip us a speech, a
rale downright Roarer!" sung out more than a dozen on 'em,
and all the men about me turned their jaws up, and opened their
mouths as if I'd been histed up there for a show.</p>

<p>"Feller citizens," sez I, "I've been a listening to you here this
night (they kept as still as mice now), and the rale American
blood has been biling in my heart to see sich carryings on and to
hear sich things said as that feller's been a talking," ("Hustle
him out," sez they, "throw him over; go it ye cripples;") but
when they got still sez I, "Since I've cum here to this city I've
almost made up my mind that there aint a ginuine teetotal patriot
among ye all, on one side or t'other, and that the least shake
of a truth would suit a downright politic feller as well as water
would a mad dog, and no better!" ("Hurra for the Yankee,"
sez they.) "Now," says I, a sticking out both arms tu once, "In
revolutionary times it was worth while to a public character to
turn solger, or patriot, or politician, for in them times folks found
so much to du that they couldn't git time to lie so like all natur
as they du now-a-days. In them glorious times a feller could
shoulder his bagonet and write out his politics on the heart of
the enemy, and there warn't no mistake in the handwriting.
(What a clapping and stomping they made here!) When they
sung out liberty, I reckon the British knew the meaning on't."
("Three cheers for the Yankee," sez they again, "Three cheers
for the Yankee,") and then they hollered and yelled and whooped
and stomped, and whooped and yelled agin and agin, like so
many Injuns jest broke loose,&mdash;then sez I&mdash;for I <em>was</em> skeered by
the noise they made, and my hair stood up on eend I felt so
dandery. "Feller citizens, as true as I live, it eenamost makes
me cuss and swear to think on't, though my par is the deacon of
a church. When the people of these times sing out liberty, a
feller can't tell whether they mean to tear down a flour store or
roast a nigger alive." (But don't you think, that when I got as
fur as here, as much as two thousand on 'em was taken dreadful
sick all tu once, and groaned out in rale agony,) "but," sez I, "I
don't wonder the old Revolutionary Patriots die off so. What
I've seen of politics is enough to send every one on 'em into the
grave with their tough old hearts broken and their foreheads wrinkled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38] </a></span>with shame at the news they have got to carry to Gineral
Washington in t'other world!"</p>

<p>I stopped to catch a little breath and was jest poking out my
arm agin to go on, for I felt as bold as a lion, and the words cum
a flowing into my mouth so thick, I couldn't but jest find room
for 'em. But the etarnal pack of varmints set up a yell that
would a frightened any man out of a year's growth; and afore I
knew which eend my head was on, they got hold on me and
pitched me down stairs, and left me a wallering in the gutter.
The first thing I knew I felt something floundering about under
me, and a great black hog that had been lying in the gutter give
a grunt, and pitched me for'ard on my face and went off squealing
a little as if he was used to being driv up by company any
time of night in them quarters.</p>

<p>Wal, I picked myself up as well as I could, and I went down
to the Express office like a streak of chalk. I found the tall
editor a setting there counting up some 'lection figgers, and he
looked eenamost tuckered out. Sez I, "Mister Editor, look a
here," and with that I showed him where they'd bust out the
back of my coat a flinging me down stairs, and how that plaguy
hog had kivered my new cassimere trousers all over with mud.
Sez he, and he couldn't help from larfing, "don't mind it, Mr.
Slick; I've got wuss usage than that many a time."</p>

<p>"Yis," sez I, as wrothy as all natur, "but I guess you haint
been pitched head for'ard into the gutter with that tarnal hog."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, a trying to keep from larfin all he could, "try
it again, Mr. Slick, you'll get used to these things by-am-by."</p>

<p>"I'll be darned to darnation if I du, and that's the eend on't!"
sez I, a doubling up my fist. "If I can't find nothing but
politics to write about, I'll go back to Weathersfield about the
quickest, I can tell you that."</p>

<p>Wal, the long and the short on it was, I got back to the sloop
and turned in awfully womblecropped, and as sore all over as a
bile. I can't go out to-day, so I have writ this letter.</p>

<p class="chaphead">A Little of Jonathan's Private Love Affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To the Editors of the Express:</span></p>

<p>Wal, you see I'm as good as my word. I hadn't hardly read
t'other letter through, afore I sot right down and begun this right
off the reel. By the living jingo! how it makes the blood bile
and tingle in a fellow's heart to see his writing printed, and to
hear people a talking about it. I wish you could a seen my
office the morning arter that fust letter cum out. I thought my
neck would'v got the cramp, I had to bow so much to the folks
that cum in to give me advice about my letters. One feller got
awful wrathy about what I writ about politics, but I jest told
him to mind his own bisness, for I guessed my eye teeth was cut
if I did cum from the country. He begun to git a leetle
imperdent, so I got up and showed him the door; and when
he wouldn't go peaceably, I jest give him a specimen of
Weathersfield sole-leather, but it's no use writing about such
varmint.</p>

<p>Now you know who I be, you won't think it very odd when
I tell you how awful womblecropt I felt to think what a chance
the old folks gave Samuel to see the world, while they kept me
tied down to the onion beds as tight as marm Jones used to be
to that leetle squalling youngen of hern, that was so cross that
its teeth couldn't cut straight, but stuck out catecorning all
round its gums.</p>

<p>It made me choke awfully to see Samuel drive off with his
wagon chuck full of wooden clocks, all painted and varnished up
as neat and shining as one of your New York gal's faces on a
Sunday. I could bit a tenpenny nail right in two without feeling
it a morsel; but it was no use quarrelling. The old man
said I hadn't got my growth yit, which was true enough, for it
kinder stunted me to be always a bending over the darnation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40] </a></span>onion patches. It was awful hard, I can tell you. I do believe,
if it hadn't been for the resting spells I got in the winter, I should
a been as bow backed as an ox yoke. I'll be darned, if it didn't
take me from fall till planting time to get the kinks out of my back.</p>

<p>Wal, I grinned and bore it purty well, considering, and, to
own the truth, it wasn't so terrible hard while Judy White lived
with marm. For a hired gal, Judy was a tarnal smart critter;
there wasn't a gal in all Weathersfield could pull an even yoke
with her a stringing onions. Nothing on arth puts a feller to
his stumps like pulling in the same team with a purty gal&mdash;and
between us, it aint no ways disagreeable to sit down in the
middle of a patch of onions all running to seed, to work with a
gal like Judy. I say nothing, but, by gracious! if my heart
hasn't beat like a partridge on a dry log, sometimes when I've
catched her a looking at me from under her great sun-bonnet;
but as for courting or anything of that sort, she kept a feller at a
distance, I can tell you. I ruther guess my ears catched it once,
but I reckon I won't tell of that though; it's better to think
about than talk over.</p>

<p>I don't mean to say that Judy had anything agin sparking in
a regular way, on Sunday nights in the east room, when the
paper curtains was all down, and the old folks had gone to bed.
It cum kinder nateral to set up till two or three o'clock, and
Judy warn't by no means old-maidish. But by-am-by the old
woman began to make a fuss cause we burned out so many of her
candles. She needn't a made such a rout, for they warn't made
of nothing but soap grease with tow wicks; and I'm sartin it
wasn't my fault if we burnt so many. I'd a been glad enough
to have sot in the dark, but Judy wouldn't hear a word on't.</p>

<p>The old woman got into a tantrum one Monday morning afore
breakfast. She called Judy all sorts of things but a good gal
and a lady, and twitted her about being poor and setting her cap
for me. At last Judy got her grit up, and I ruther guess she
finished off the old woman in fine style. I suffered a few
between them, I can tell you. The old woman began to brag
about Samuel, for she's felt mighty crank about him ever since
he had that great dinner give to him down on the Canada line
there&mdash;and sez she to Judy, sez she&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41] </a></span></p>
<p>"I don't see how on arth you aim to think of such imperdence
as sitting up with my Jonathan. Why, aint my Samuel one of
the biggest authors in the country, aint he hand and glove with
all the judges and lawyers, and the New York editors, and all the
big bugs fur and near? I'd have you to know my boys aint men
of the common chop, and I guess any on 'em will look a plaguey
sight higher than to take up with a hired gal. Why, who knows
but Jonathan will be as illustrated a man as his brother one of
these days!"</p>

<p>I couldn't begin to give the least idea of the stream o'talk the
old woman let out on the poor gal. But, by gracious, I rather
guess she missed it a few. I wish you could a seen Judy White's
face, for by the living hokey, if it didn't turn five hundred
colours in a minit. I raly thought the critter would a jumped
out of her skin she was so awful mad.</p>

<p>"I don't care that for your son, Miss Slick," sez she, a snapping
her fingers in the old woman's face, "I can marry his betters any
day. I wouldn't have him, not if every hair in his head was
shining with diamonds; no, not if he'd go down on his knees to
me; you make a terrible fuss cause Sam's gone sneaking about
among decent people, but, after all, what is he but a wooden
clock pedler, and as for you, you old vinegar-faced good for
nothin&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>She was a going on to give poor marm an awful drubbing, but
I always think a feller must be a mean shote that 'ill stand mum
and hear any body call his mother names, whether she desarves
them or not. So I stepped up and stood right afore Judy, and I
looked her straight in the face, and, sez I, "Miss Judy," sez I,
"I don't want to hear no more of this ere; come now, you and
marm jest hush up, and don't let me hear another darned word,
for I won't stand it."</p>

<p>With that marm put her linsey woolsey apron up to her face,
and begun to boo hoo right out, and, sez she, "It comes awful
tough to be trod on in one's own house; I won't bear it, so there
now."</p>

<p>"Now, Judy," sez I, kinder coaxing, "jest go and make up;
marm's a good-hearted critter, and you know it's kinder nateral
for wimmin folks to git a little crabbed once in a while."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42] </a></span></p>
<p>By gracious, if I wouldn't rather break a yoke of steers any
day, than try to make up a quarrel between two wimmin when
they once get their dander up; and of all horned cattle Judy
White did take the rag off the bush when she once got agoing.</p>

<p>"Git out of my way, yeu mean, snaeking critter you," sez she,
hitting me a slap over the chops that made my teeth rattle; "I
won't make up, nor touch tu; I only feel sorry that I ever demeaned
myself to set up with you; I'll leave the house this
minnit."</p>

<p>Out of the room she went like a she-hurricane, and after she
had picked up her duds she made tracks for home, without as
much as bidding one of us good by.</p>

<p>It's curios how men will git used to eenamost anything; now I
don't purtend to say that I hadn't a kind of a sneaking notion after
Judy White, but somehow when I seen the tears come into the
old woman's eyes, dimming her old steel-bowed spectacles, the
water always would start into my own eyes, spite of all I could do
to keep it out; so it wasn't to be expected that I should not feel
disagreeable when the two got their dander up, and went into
such a tantrum with each other. But there sot the old man a
chonking an apple, and kinder larfin inside of him all the time,
jest as he'd a looked on to see two cats scratch and spit at one
another. I axed him how he could du so, and he tossed the
apple core out of the winder, and puckered up his mouth and
said, "I hadn't got used to the wimmen folks yit; the best way
with them kind o' things was to let 'em alone."</p>

<p>Now it wouldn't a been much of a chore to have gone over
to old Mr. White's two or three times a week, and if Judy had
done the clean thing toward the old woman, I don't know but I
should a gone to see her over there, but somehow a gal kicks
over the milk pail when she lets her ebenezer git up before a
feller, jest as he's beginning to hanker arter her. I couldn't
make up my mind to tackle in with a critter that had shown
such an allfired spiteful temper, so the next Sunday night I let
her go home from singing school alone. I saw her look back
kinder anxious two or three times, and jest for the minit my
heart riz up in my throat till it eenamost choked me. But I kept
a stiff upper lip, and went on without seeming to mind her;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43] </a></span>and then she tossed up her head and begun to sing, as if she
wanted to show me that she didn't care a cent for all I could
do.</p>

<p>I felt awful bad for a day or two, but a feller must be a sap-head
if he can't make up his mind to give a gal the mitten when
he thinks she desarves it. Now if Judy had had the small-pox,
and had been pitted all over like a honey comb, I'd a stood by
her to the last minnit; but somehow I couldn't git over the
awful basting she gave marm. I do like to see old folks
treated well, let 'em do what they will, and a gal can't be fit to
bring up a family if she doesn't know how to keep her own
temper. Besides, she hasn't much true ginuine love for a chap,
when she won't try to put up with the faults of his relations for
his sake.</p>

<p>Wal, the long and the short of it was, I gin Judy White
the sack right off the reel, without stopping to chew the matter
a bit.</p>

<p>Wall, arter this, working alone grew awful tedious, and I begun
to hanker to see the world. So as father was loading up a sloop to
send down to New York, I came a little of Samuel's soft sodder
over the old man, and told him how much better I could
sell off the onions and red cabbages, than eenamost any body else;
and at last he said I might come down as a kinder supercargo.
So he filled up the hold with potaters, real blue noses, I can tell
you, and piled up a whole crop of garden sarce on the deck, and
we sot sail down the river.</p>

<p>Now, I'd made up my mind to stay in the city when I once
got clear of the humstead, but you may guess I didn't let out a
word to the old folks, for it al'es hurts my feelings to see marm
take on, and I didn't like to make the old man rip out <em>too</em> much,
for he was a deacon of the Presbyterian Church. We was three
days a coming down the river, and it made me awful wrathy to
see that lazy old critter, "the Cleopatra," go by us on her way
to the city and back agin before we got into the East river. We
give her two cheers each time, but neither on 'em come from
below the palate, I can tell you. We got into Peck slip at
last safe and sound, and if I didn't jump on to the wharf as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44] </a></span>spry as a cricket, then there's no snakes on the green mountain
that's all.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan's Opinions of Ministerial Interference&mdash;A Card of Invitation,
and an Evening Party at Cousin Beebe's, in which Jonathan
makes some Mistakes and a Lady Acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>I have just received your letter, and so I sot right down to
answer it; for what you writ about my treating Captin Doolittle,
and using sich bad language, made me feel bad enough. I don't
know the reason on it, but when a feller's away from hum, it
makes him feel awful oneasy to think that he's done anything to
hurt his par or mar's feelings.</p>

<p>Now, about that Captin Doolittle business, I don't think arter
all, I was much to blame. What I writ about him hurt the critter's
feelings a good deal, and I didn't know of any way to make
up but to treat, and so I did give him a drink of New England
and a long nine or so, but I didn't drink any myself, not a single
horn, and it warn't more 'an half fair for the minister to begin
at you about it arter meeting last Sunday, and to tell you that
you hadn't brought me up in the virtue and admonition of the
Lord, and to say that "you be darned" and "darnation," is jest
as bad as cussing and swearing right out. For him to take it on
himself to twit you, and say that, "jest as the twig is bent the
tree's inclined," is consarned mean, and I wouldn't bear it nor a
touch tu if I was you. He knows as well as can be, that if I
warn't bent right it wasn't no fault of your'n, for I'm sartin it
wouldn't a been in the natur of things to have twisted me any
other way than head for'erd, if you calculated on my weeding
the onions as they ought to be.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45] </a></span></p>
<p>Now, the truth on it is, I begin to think that your ministers
there in Connecticut pull the bit on the church members a leetle
too tight sometimes, and instid of giving you good holesome doctrine,
right pure out of the Bible, and taking the potaters and
apples and wood and chickens and turkies that the deacons and
old maids send to them as part pay, they sometimes contrive to
make their being ministers an excuse for poking their fingers into
every body's pie as well as their own.</p>

<p>I am afeard you won't like to hear me say so; but it does make
me awful wrothy to hear that the minister threatened to turn
you out of the church if you let me go on so&mdash;but you needn't
be a bit consarned about that. He'd no more turn you out of
the meeting than he'd strike his own granny, not as long as you
own the best farm in all Weathersfield, and send him a fat turkey
every thanksgiving day, besides paying pew tax and all the
other taxes, as you du. I don't know what he might du if you
was to fail and bust up; for as soon as a man begins to get poor,
the ministers grow awful particlar about his morality and religion;
but there's no fear of that; so jest tell him the next time
he threatens to church you for what I'm a doing down here in
York, that you'll serve him as the parliament in England used to
fix their King when he begun to grow obstropulous, and as they
would sarve that little skittish Queen of theirn if she wanted to
have a way of her own. Tell him you'll "stop his supplies."
Don't send him a turkey next thanksgiving, and tell marm not
to carry a single doughnut nor a skein of tow yarn to the next
spinning-bee that his church members make for him. I ruther
guess that this will bring him to his senses. As for me, tell him
to go to grass and eat bog hay till's he as fat as Nebuchadnezzar.
I aint one of his church members any how, and if I was, I
shouldn't ask him to take care of me. I know what I'm about,
and he needn't be scared on my account. I know as well as he
does that York has a tarnal sight of bad people in it; and I
know, too, that there's a good many rale down right honest, hull-hearted
fellers here, tu. As for the wimmen, though they are
dreadfully stuck up, and eenamost ruin their husbands with dressing
fine and giving parties, there's some of them that aint to be
sneezed at in a fog, I can tell you. I don't want to say any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46] </a></span>thing to hurt the minister's feelings, but he needn't cum his
church threats over me, for it won't du no good, I'll be darned
if it will.</p>

<p>Wal, now that I've gin the minister a piece of my mind, free
gratis for nothing, I may as well write what's been a going on
down here in York.</p>

<p>One morning a little black boy cum into my office with a heap
of letters, and he give me one without speaking a word, and
went off agin. I opened the letter, and there dropped out a
square piece of white pasteboard, and on it was printed, in leetle
finefied letters, "Mrs. Beebe at home&mdash;Thursday evening."</p>

<p>Wal, sez I to myself, if this don't take the rag off the bush&mdash;cousin
Mary's got to gadding about so much, that she has to
send round word when she is a going to stay at hum one evening.
I do wonder how Mr. Beebe can stand it. I shouldn't
blame him if he took to drink, or got into bad company, if his
wife goes on so; for if a woman won't stay to hum nights, and
keep every thing nice and snug agin her husband comes away
from his bisness, a feller must have an allfired good heart, and a
good head tu, if he don't go off and git into scrapes on his own
hook.</p>

<p>I sot down and histed my feet on the top of the stove, and
begun to think it all over, till it seemed to be my duty to go and
talk to cousin Mary about the way she was a going on. I remembered
what a purty, smart little critter she used to be when
she lived in Connecticut, and how kind hearted she was; and
then I thought of her queer stuck up ways since I'd seen her
here; and it was as much as I could du to keep the tears out of
my eyes, for if cousin Mary had been my own sister, I couldn't
a liked her better than I did when she was a gal.</p>

<p>Wal, arter thinking it all over, I made up my mind to go and
ask John if he didn't think it best for me to go and talk to her,
for I felt kinder loth to meddle with his business, if he didn't
want me tu; and anyhow, I didn't expect much thanks for giving
her advice&mdash;for when a feller steps in between man and wife,
it's like trying to part a cat and a dog, and he is lucky enough
if he don't git scratched by one and worried to death by t'other;
but I looked at the piece of paste-board agin, and made up my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47] </a></span>mind that something ought to be done, and if John didn't take
it up, I would; for if there's any thing I du hate on arth, it's a
gadding woman&mdash;and I didn't feel as if I could give cousin Mary
up quite yit.</p>

<p>Wal, I took my hat, and put my hands in my trousers' pockets,
and walked along kinder slow through Cherry street, till I cum
to Franklin Square. I did'nt seem to mind any body, for my
heart felt sort a heavy with thinking of old times. I kept a
looking down on the stun walk, and felt eenamost as much alone
as if I'd been in a Connecticut cramberry swamp; yit there was
more than fifty people a walking up and down the Square. I'd
got jest agin the old Walton House, that was built afore the
revolutionary war, but was so busy a thinking, that I forgot to
look up at the arms and figgers carved out over the door, every
one of 'em put up there by a British tory family afore Gineral
Washington drove them out of house and hum&mdash;when all to once
somebody hit me a slap on my shoulder that made me jump
eenamost into the middle of next week. I looked up, and there
was cousin Beebe a larfin like all natur because he'd made me
jump so.</p>

<p>"Hello, cousin Jonathan!" sez he, "what the deuce are you
thinking about?"</p>

<p>"About that," says I, a forking out the piece of pasteboard
from my trousers' pocket, "a little stuck up nigger jest gin me
that ere."</p>

<p>"Wal, what of it?" says cousin John, "it's all right I see, I
suppose you'll come of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sez I, "I was a jest a going down to see you about it,
and if you'd jest as livs I'll go right straight up and talk to her
now; I feel as if I could say enough to break her heart, if it has
got ever so tough."</p>

<p>With that Cousin Beebe bust right out a larfin. "That's
right," says he, "you're coming on bravely, don't talk about one
heart, I havn't the least doubt but you'll break a dozen&mdash;you
literary chaps carry all before you in that way."</p>

<p>I felt kinder unsartin how to take his meaning, for it seemed
as if he was a poking fun at me, for wanting to give his wife
some good advice; at last I spoke up, and sez I&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48] </a></span></p>
<p>"If cousin Mary has got <em>one</em> good sound heart left to break,
since she came here to York, she's a good deal better off than I
took her to be."</p>

<p>With that John begun to stare, and at last he bust out a larfin
again.</p>

<p>"Why," sez he, "you haint no idee of getting up a flirtation
with Mary, have you? upon my word, cousin Slick, you are a
shaking off all your steady habits in a hurry. It generally takes
a feller, though, some months' training, in fashionable society,
before he can bring himself to make love to another man's
wife."</p>

<p>"Now," sez I, "cousin Beebe, what on arth do you mean? as
true as I live I shall git wrathy if you keep on in this way. Aint
my father a deacon of the church? Aint I sot under Minister
Smith's preaching since I was knee high to a toad? It's an
allfired shame for you to talk to me as if I was a going to demean
myself by making love to anybody, much less to another man's
wife. When I du make love, sir, I can tell you what, it will be
with a hull heart and an honest one tu; I'll never be afeard to
look a girl in the face when I ask her to take me, or to let her
look in mine for fear she'll see villain writ out in my eyes. As
for your married women, they needn't be afeared that anybody,
I don't care how imperdent he is, will make love to them, without
they begin first. Now, Cousin Beebe, seeing as we've gone
so far, jest look a here, see what your wife has sent to me!"</p>

<p>With that I give him the paper which the pasteboard was done
up in, where Cousin Mary had writ, "Mrs. Beebe hopes Mr.
Slick will not fail to come."</p>

<p>Cousin John read it, and sez he, "Wal, what harm is there in
this? I'm sure it was very thoughtful of Mary, and I'm glad she
did it. You will go of course; there will be a good deal of company,
and they are all anxious to see you since your letters come
out in the Express."</p>

<p>"What," sez I, "is Miss Beebe a going to have a party&mdash;why
didn't she say so then?"</p>

<p>"Oh it's only a <em>swarry</em>, she often has them," says he.</p>

<p>"A what?" sez I.</p>

<p>"A <em>swarry</em>&mdash;a <em>conversationanny</em>," sez he. I couldn't think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49] </a></span>what he meant, but I remembered that jest afore Mary was
married she used to have hysteric fits, now and then, and I
thought they give them things some other name down here in
York.</p>

<p>"Dear me," sez I, "I'm sorry, but if I can do any good I'll
come up, I s'pose you'll have a doctor."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," sez he, "there'll be two or three, besides lots of
lawyers, and poets, and editors."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," sez I, "why what will you du with them
all?"</p>

<p>"Oh Mary will take care of them," sez he, "she does those
things very well, indeed, considering she was brought up in the
country."</p>

<p>"But I thought you wanted us to take care of her," sez I.</p>

<p>"Why, of course you will all make yourselves as agreeable as
you can; there will be lots of harnsome wimmen there, and I
haint the least doubt we shall have a pleasant party."</p>

<p>"A party!" sez I, "is Miss Beebe a going to have a party?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," sez he, a looking puzzled; "didn't you understand
that by the card and the note?" I felt my heart rise up
in my mouth, and I could have begun to dance on the stun walk.
I do believe nothing on arth makes a feller feel so happy as to
find out that somebody he can't help but like, but has been a
thinking hard things about, don't desarve them. Cousin John
kept a looking at me, and I begun to feel awful streaked, for it
seemed to me as if he suspected all that I'd been a thinking agin
his wife. Arter a minit, I up and took my hand out of my
pocket, and I took hold of his'n, and, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin John, I've been making a darned fool of myself; I
didn't know what this ere piece of pasteboard meant, and I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, Cousin Jonathan," sez he, all of a sudden shaking
my hand, "you know what it means now&mdash;so come up on
Thursday. Now I think of it&mdash;you had better git a new suit of
clothes; that blue coat and those shiny brass buttons did very
well for Weathersfield; but here something a little more stylish
will be better&mdash;supposing you go over to the Broadway tailors
and let them fit you out."</p>

<p>"Not as you know on," sez I, a taking hold of the edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50] </a></span>my coat, and a dustin off the buttons with my red silk pocket
handkercher. "The picter that they printed of me in the Express
newspaper was taken in these clothes; and if you'd jest as
livs, I'll keep 'em on."</p>

<p>Cousin John warn't to be put off so, and at last he cum his
soft sodder over me, till I agreed to get another suit of clothes,
New York cut, for parties and meetings. So we shook hands,
and he turned and went back to his store agin, for he was a
coming up to my office; and I jest turned into a narrer street,
and took a short cut across to the Express Office. The Editors
give me some money, for they aint no ways mean about paying
me for what I write for their paper; and they put on the soft
sodder purty strong about my letters. They said that everybody
was a reading them and a trying to find out something about me,
and that lots of young ladies had seen my picter and were a dying
to git acquainted with me. I warn't much surprised at it.
Arter putting the poetry into my letters so strong, I was sartin
that all the gals would be a talking about me. Nothing takes
with them like poetry. I had my eye teeth cut when I wrote
that, I can tell you. I couldn't help but feel tickled to hear them
praising me so; but somehow one gits used to being puffed up,
and arter a little while a feller don't seem to care so much
about it.</p>

<p>Wal, I pocketed the cash and went to the tailors' store; it was
a plaguy harnsome place, and there were two or three spruce-looking
chaps standing about; but they looked at me kinder
slanting, as if they thought I didn't want to buy anything; and
I could see one on them looking arnestly at my coat, as if he
didn't like the fit on't. I declare I begun to get ashamed of the
old blue, when I cum to see the harnsome coats and vests and
trousers hanging around.</p>

<p>"Have you got any first rate superfine broadcloth coats and
trousers to sell here?" sez I, a chinking the loose change in my
trousers' pocket a leetle, jest to show them that I was as good as
the city banks, and held out specie payments yit.</p>

<p>"Yes," sez one of the clerks, a bowing. "What color do you
wish to look at?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I ruther think I'll take that color that looks so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51] </a></span>much like burnt coffee, or else a rale indigo blue, I aint particular,
only I want it in the tip of the fashion&mdash;a rale harnsome fit, and
all that, for I'm a going to a swarry and a conversationanny, and
I want to shine like a new pin."</p>

<p>While I was a talking, a knowing sort of a feller cum out of the
back room, and when he see me a looking at a coat that I seemed
to take a notion tu he cum up and begun to talk about it&mdash;he
pinted out the silk lining and the way it was stuffed and quilted
under the arms, and would have me try it on. So I stripped off
the old coat and put the new one on. I can tell you it sot as
slick as grease; there warn't a wrinkle or a pucker in it, from the
top of the velvet collar to the eend of the flap. I looked as trim
and as genteel as could be in it&mdash;when it was buttoned over tight
it seemed to me that I warn't bigger round than a quart cup.</p>

<p>Sez the gentleman, sez he, "that's a capital fit, sir, you won't
du better than to take it."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I don't know as I shall, I kinder seem to like
myself in it&mdash;how much do you ask, hey?"</p>

<p>"Why," sez he, "that's a fust rate coat, superfine cloth and
beautiful trimmings; but the times are hard, and I'll let you have
it low for cash;" and then he sot his price; "but," sez he, "you
mustn't tell how cheap you got it, for I couldn't sell any more at
that price."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I ruther guess I'll take it; now let us look at
some of your vests and trousers. I shall have to beat you down
a leetle on them, for I'm raly afeard my money won't hold out."</p>

<p>"Not much fear of that," sez he, and he opened a drawer and
took out an allfired heap of trousers. Arter I'd tumbled 'em over
awhile, I picked out a pair of rale harnsome checkered ones, and
then I bought a black vest with yaller stripes all over it, and between
us, I ruther guess it made a considerable hole in the money
that I got from the editors of the Express, to pay for 'em all.
The man had done 'em up, and I was jest a going to take them
hum under my arm, but sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where will you have them sent, sir?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, arter thinking a minit, "you may direct them to
Mr. Jonathan Slick, and send them round to the Express office,
if you've no objection."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52] </a></span></p>
<p>I wish you <em>could</em> a seen the feller! he seemed to be all struck
up into a heap when I said this, and the clarks looked at each
other, and cum toward us as if they had never seen anybody that
wrote for newspapers afore.</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick," sez the head man, making a bow eenamost to the
ground, "I'm much obliged for your custom, and I hope you'll
cum agin. If you find the clothes suit you, perhaps you'll send
any of your friends to our establishment, who happen to want
any thing in our line. We shall always be happy and proud to
sarve Mr. Slick or any of his friends."</p>

<p>Here he made another bow, and I stepped back, and bent for'ard
a trifle, jest to let him see that his soft sodder warn't put on
at all coarse; and, sez I, "Wal, I'll try the clothes, and if they
turn out fust-rate, mebby I'll mention where I got them in one
of my letters. There is a good many chaps jest a going to be
married about Weathersfield, and it won't do them no harm to
know where to come for the wedding clothes."</p>

<p>With that the tailor bowed agin, and, sez he, "Mr. Slick, where
shall I have the honor of sending you one of my fust-rate vests,
or a pair of harnsome pantaloons? I'll take your measure, and
have them made on purpose for you."</p>

<p>"Wal, now, I don't know as I can afford to buy any more jest
yit," sez I; "but when these are wore out, I think as likely as
not I shall cum agin."</p>

<p>"Oh," sez he, a rubbing his hands a little, and a smiling and
bowing agin, "let us take your measure, and we shan't quarrel
about the pay, we shall be most proud to supply you with a good
article; and if you will accept of them, the honor"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh," sez I, a bowing, "you are very obliging, I'm sure,
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Where shall we send them when they are done?" says he.</p>

<p>"Direct them as you did the others, to Mr. Jonathan Slick, to
the care of the Editors of the Express. And look a here,
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, I wish you'd try and make the trousers so they will
stay down, and not keep a hitching up to the top of my boots, if
you can."</p>

<p>"Depend on it they will please you," sez he, a follering me to
the door, "Good morning, Mr. Slick, I'm very much obliged to
you for calling;" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53] </a></span>and with that he made another bow, and I give
him one back again, and made tracks for Cherry street, as tickled
as could be.</p>

<p>Wal, when Thursday cum, I begun to feel mighty anxious about
the party; I had all the clothes sent down to my office, besides
a prime hat, which I got, and a pair of real dandy boots that sot
to my foot like wax.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark I shut myself up and begun to fix. I
declare I never did see anything fit as them checkered trousers
did; they sot to my legs like the tin moles to a pair of tallow
candles in freezing time, and I felt as if I'd been jest corked up
in a junk bottle, foot foremost. Arter I got them on, and all
buttoned up tight, I begun to think that I should have to go to
the party in the blue mixed socks that marm knit for me, the
last thing afore I cum away from hum; for my feet had got hung
in a slip of leather, that was sowed across the bottom of the
trousers' legs, and how to get 'em out, so as to put on my boots,
I couldn't tell. I pulled and kicked till I eenamost bust off my
gallows' buttons but they wouldn't give a morsel, and at last I
jest took hold on the leathers, and I give them an allfired jerk
till they slipped over my heel, and arter that I made out to roll
up the trouser's legs till I could pull my boots on. When I pulled
them down again the leathers stuck out from the heel of my boot
behind, as if I had got spurs on; I didn't exactly like the feel of
it, but "Who cares," sez I to myself, "a feller may as well be out
of the world as out of the fashion, especially down here in York."</p>

<p>As soon as I'd got my trousers purty well braced up I put on
the vest, and it sot like a button, for there wur holes behind and
strings that laced up like a gal's corsets, and I girted up purty
tight I can tell you. I snuggers, them yaller sprigs did glisten,
and arter I'd put on the new stock that I bought along with the
clothes, I rather guess I cut a dash. It was all bowed off and
curlacued over, with red and yaller sprigs, and it made my neck
look as slim and shiney as our big red rooster's used to when he
stretched his head out in the sun to see how many old hens and
spring pullets he'd got about him.</p>

<p>I swanny, if I hadn't been in such a hurry to git on my new
things that I forgot to wash my hands and face till jest as I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54] </a></span>a putting on my coat! I peeked in the little looking-glass that
I've got hung up in my office, and my hair was standing out every
which way; and somehow my teeth looked as yaller as if I'd
been chawin tobaccy a hull week. What to du I couldn't tell,
but I picked up the Express, and looked into the advertisements
to see if I could find out anything to make my grinders white&mdash;there
warn't nothing there; but I happened to think that I'd
seen Doctor Sherman's tooth-paste puffed in some of the papers:
and though I don't mean to patronize anybody that don't advertise
in our paper, I thought, seeing as I was in a hurry, per'aps
it would be as well to go out and get some of it. I slipped on
my old coat, and down I went into Nassau street, eenamost to the
corner of Fulton street, and I bought a little cheny box full of
red stuff, about as thick as hasty pudding, and as sweet as honey,
and back I went again to the office like a streak of lightning.</p>

<p>I didn't know how to use the stuff, but think siz I, they must
rub it on their teeth somehow, so I spread some on the corner of
my towel, and began to polish away like all natur. It warn't
two minits afore my teeth was as white as a nigger's; so I jest
washed them off in the hand basin, and went at my hair, tooth
and nail.</p>

<p>How on arth these York chaps make their hair curl so, I can't
guess&mdash;I tried to coax mine to twist up a little, on each side of
my face, but it warn't of no use. I combed it out with a fine
tooth comb, and I put some hog's lard scented with some of the
essence of peppermint that marm give me to use if I should git
the stomach ache down here, and I twisted it round my fingers,
but it wouldn't stay curled a minit; so at last I gave it up for a
bad job, and put on my new coat as mad as could be.</p>

<p>I ruther guess you couldn't have found a better looking chap
of my size anywhere about, than I was, when I put on my yaller
gloves, and fixed my new red silk hankercher in my coat pocket,
so as to let one eend hang out a leetle, arter I'd put a few of the
peppermint drops on it&mdash;and the way I pulled foot up Pearl street
and toward Broadway, wasn't slow I can tell you. It takes a
feller forever to fix here in York&mdash;I'd ruther slick up for twenty
quiltings and apple-bees, than for one swarry, I can tell you. I
was a'most skared to death, for fear I should be too late, for it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55] </a></span>was eenajest dark afore I left the office, so I didn't let the grass
grow under my feet on the way to cousin Beebe's, you may be
sartin.</p>

<p>When I got to cousin Beebe's door, I pulled the silver knob
kinder softly, for I felt a sort of palpitation of the heart at going
into a room chuck full of quality; and I jest pulled up my dickey
a little, and felt to see if my hankercher hung out of my pocket
about right, afore the nigger opened the door. At last he made
out to cum, and when I asked if all the folks was tu hum, he
begun to show his chalkies jest as he did afore, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Yes, but they haint come down yit."</p>

<p>With that I pitched in, and, sez I, "Look a here, Cuffy, none
of your grinning at me, but jest mind your own bisness. I've
come to see the swarry that Mr. Beebe's been a buying to treat
his company with; so jest shut your darned liver lips, and show
it to me."</p>

<p>"Oh," sez he, a trying to choke in, "the swarry is going to be
in the drawing room there, walk in."</p>

<p>"What, haint it come yit," sez I, "and where's all the folks?&mdash;I
thought he was going to have a party, too."</p>

<p>"Wal, so he is," sez the nigger, "but they haint begun to come
yit."</p>

<p>"Wal, now," sez I to myself, "If this don't beat all creation.
Now, in Connecticut it would a been eenamost time to go hum
agin; these Yorkers du beat all for laziness." With that I went
into the room. By the living hokey, I never see anything like
it! It was enough to dazzle one's eyes; the two doors were slid
back into the partition, and it seemed like one great ball-room;
and, besides that, there were too great winders at the further
eend, that opened into a place that seemed kinder like a garden.
I didn't know what to make of it, for it was chuck full of posies
that looked as bright and as green as if it was the fourth of July,
and yit it was a freezing like everything out of doors. I went
down the room and stuck my head through the winder, and as
true as I live it was a little room all full of bushes and roses
sot up on benches; it had a glass ruff, and the sides were one allfired
great winder, with little vines a hanging down over it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56] </a></span>a great tree chuck full of something that looked like oranges, a
standing up agin it.</p>

<p>There were five or six cages full of little yaller birds a hanging
among the bushes, and right back of the tree stuck over with
oranges, stood a marble woman a holding up a bunch of grapes
cut out of marble, with a lot of green leaves twisted round it as
nateral as could be. It was awful harnsome, but I swan if it
didn't make me feel streaked to look at her a standing there
among the bushes, for she hadn't the least rag of kivering on,
and it raly was enough to make a feller blush to see her a holding
the grapes over her head, as if she wanted to make people look
at her.</p>

<p>Think sez I, is this the swarry that Cousin Beebe has bought
to show his company: I reckon he'd better have bought a calico
frock or something of that sort to kiver over it. I couldn't bear
to look at it, and so I jest turned about and stood still by the
winder with my eyes wide open, for at the t'other eend of the
room was another garden with a naked swarry and bushes in it,
as much like the one I'd been a looking in as could be. I went
toward it, but stopped short, and burst out a larfin all by myself,
for it was nothing but the same garden a shining in the great big
looking glass, that I wrote to you about, that hung up right
afore me.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;Think, says I, is this the swarry that Cousin Beebe has bought to show his
company: I reckon he&#39;d better have bought a calico frock or something of that
sort to kiver over it.&quot;</p>

<p>Arter I'd stole another sly look at the orange tree and the
swarry, I jest stuck my hands in my pockets as well as I could,
considering they were so tight, and stickin out one foot, leaned
back again the winder frame and looked around the room. A
hot sweltering sun in dog days could not have been brighter than
everything was. There were two great things hung by chains
from the middle of both rooms, with hundreds and hundreds of
chunks of glass a hanging all over them; and they were stuck
full of candles as white as curd, all a burning and blazing, till
they looked like a heap of ice and snow hung up to melt in a
fire. Both the mantle shelfs were kivered over with them things
that I told you about that looked so much like gold; some on
'em were lamps, and some had great white candles stuck into
them; and there were lots on lots of flowers set in among them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57] </a></span>that smelt as sweet as new hay, and such a shining and glistening
I never did see. The best on it all was, that the whopping looking
glasses on both eends the rooms made them seem twice as
long, and as if they had a great many more things in them than
they raly had. There were two round tables made out of some
kind of cloudy stun, about as large as marm's cherry-wood tea-table,
a standing at both eends of the rooms, all kivered over
with leetle picters and all sorts of play-things, besides heaps of
books with morocco backs and sprigged off with gold, all lying
among them every which way, as if somebody had been in a
hurry, and had pitched them on the tables without staying to
pile them up.</p>

<p>Besides all that, they had brought in a whole heap more of
them footstools that I told you about, and they had put square
kind of back pillows all tossled off and kivered over with flowers
at the eends of the two settees, besides a good many other things
that I haint time to write about. "Wal," sez I to myself, "if
Cousin Beebe don't take the shine off these New Yorkers in his
party I lose my guess; but I wonder where on arth he contrives
to raise money to do it with these hard times, for all this must
have cost him a few, I'm sartin."</p>

<p>Jest as I was thinking this, the cuffy come into the room, and
sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a here, snow ball, when is the party a coming, I've seen
the swarry all I want tu, and I'm eenamost tired of standing
here and doing nothing."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, "I s'pose they'll be here in an hour or two,&mdash;it
aint mor'n eight o'clock yit."</p>

<p>"I rather guess I shan't stay here all alone any longer," sez I,
and with that I buttened up my coat, and jest took a walk into
the Apollo gallery to see the picters, till it was time for the party
to cum. I haint time to say anything about the heap of harnsome
picters that I saw, and besides, I mean to write you all
about them some day afore long, for they are curios I can tell
you. I felt so much pleased with looking at 'em, that it was long
after nine afore I thought of it. So I jest started off agin for
Cousin Beebe's. When I went in this time the rooms were brim
full of people, and I was eenamost scared to death. I unbuttoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58] </a></span>my coat and pulled up my dicky a leetle, besides giving my hair
a brush&mdash;and then I went in with my head straight up, and my
new fur hat in my hand; jest as I used to go in the singers' seat,
there in Weathersfield. Think sez I, I'll jest let 'em know that
I haint been to dancing school for nothing. So I held my hat a
leetle afore me by the rim, and I made a genteel bow, first to one
side and then to t'other. Arter that, I went and sot down on
one of the settees, and I looked round for cousin Mary, for I felt
kinder awk'ard; and I hadn't the least idee that she wouldn't
have come up, as she used to in Weathersfield, and put out her
hand and ask me if she should take my hat. But there I sot with
it between my hands, a fingering it over as if it had been a hot
potater, and she never cum near me. I felt dreadfully, for there
was a lot of harnsome gals a staring at me, and a puckering up
their purty leetle mouths, as if they would a gin the world to larf
right out. Arter a minit cousin John cum up to me, and
sez he,</p>

<p>"Cousin Slick, I'm glad you've cum, step in the next room and
take a glass of wine with me. Mrs. Beebe is so crowded you
won't get near her jest yit."</p>

<p>I got up, and we went into the entry way together, and then
says cousin Beebe to the nigger, "Here, Ben, take Mr. Slick's
hat."</p>

<p>The nigger took my hat and carried it off up stairs, and, arter
a few minits, cousin John went back into the room where the
company was, without saying another word about the wine.</p>

<p>"You had better go up and speak to Mary, now," sez he,
kinder low; "there she stands by Count &mdash;&mdash;." I didn't hear
the name, but it was some darned crabbed word, that was enough
to choke a feller.</p>

<p>I hadn't looked round much when I cum in before, for somehow
my head didn't feel steddy; but arter cousin John cum and
spoke to me, I didn't seem to mind it, so I jest looked round as
bold as could be. I declare I never did see any body dressed out
as cousin Mary was. She had on a frock of shining satin, with
harnsome pink sprigs all over it, and there was a great wide
ruffle round the bottom, made out of something that looked as
white and thin as a gal's veil the day arter she's married; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59] </a></span>that was hitched up on one side half way to her waist, with a
pink rose, made out of ribbon with long eends, that fell down
eenamost to the floor. A heap of some kind of shiney thin stuff
was ruffled round her bosom, and hung down round her arms, for
her frock sleeves were short, and made like a little gal's; and she
had on a pair of white gloves, with ribbon tops to 'em. One on
'em was fastened round her wrist with a wide piece of gold, and
three or four bands set full of shiny stuns wos on t'other arm,
which was plaguey white, or else I suppose she would not have
let folks see it.</p>

<p>Mary al'ers had a tarnal purty little foot, but I never see it look
so small as it did in that glistening white shoe of hern, and to
own the rale downright truth, she didn't seem to be much
ashamed to show it, but kept it stuck out from under her ruffler,
as if she'd made up her mind to be ready to make a curchy any
minit. There was one thing that kinder puzzled me a good
deal; Mary's skin never was over white, but somehow it looked
like wax work, that night, and you never see a meadow pink
look brighter than her cheeks did; but instead of coming into
her face and going away again, as every man loves to see the
color in a gal's face when she's a talking, and knows that he's a
looking at her, Mary's always kept jest so; it didn't seem as if
an earthquake would make her turn pale. The hair hung in long
curls down her cheeks and on her shoulders, jest as it did the
other day, and she had a great white rose stuck in among the
curls, on one side of her head, that looked as if it hadn't but jest
been picked off the bushes.</p>

<p>I looked at her putty earnestly, I can tell you, and I do think
she would have been a critter that John might be proud of, if it
warn't for that stuck up way which she's got since she cum down
here to York. She don't du nothing on arth nateral, and as she
did when she was a gal in Connecticut. Instead of standing up
straight, and speaking to her company as if she was glad to see
them, she stood with one foot stuck out and her hands jest
crossed afore her, and kinder stooping for-ard, as if she couldn't
but jest stand alone; I never see a critter's back stuck up as
her's was, I raly thought she was a getting the rickets, and I felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60] </a></span>so anxious about it that I turned to cousin Beebe, afore I went
up to speak to her, and sez I, a sort of low&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin John, how did your wife hurt her back so? I declare
it makes me feel awfully to see what a great hump she's got a
growing since she cum away from Connecticut!"</p>

<p>With that cousin John looked at her and larfed a little, but I
could see he didn't feel jest right, and arter a minit he said,
sez he,</p>

<p>"Hush, cousin, you must not speak so loud; it's true Mary has
put on rather <em>too</em> much bustle, but it's the fashion, you see." I
looked round, and as true as you live there warn't a gal in the
room that hadn't her back a sticking out jest the same way.
Such a set of humpbacked critters I never did put my eyes on,
and yit they all stood about a smiling and a talking to the fellers
as if nothing ailed them, poor things! I never see a set of folks
dressed out so much, and so awfully stuck up as they were.
Some of the gals had feathers in their hair, and some had flowers
or gold chains twisted among their curls, and I didn't see one there
that wasn't dressed up in her silks and satins as crank as could
be. As for the men, I thought I should have haw hawed right
out a larfin to see some of 'em; there was one chap talking to
Miss Beebe with his hair parted from the top of his head down
each side of his face, and it hung down behind all over his coat
collar like a young gal's just before she begins to wear a comb;
and there was two bunches of hair stuck out on his upper lip right
under his nose, like a cat's whiskers when she begins to get her
back up. Every time he spoke the hair kinder riz up and moved
about till it was enough to make a feller crawl all over to look at
him. Think sez I, if it wouldn't be fun to see that varmint try to
eat. If he didn't get his victuals tangled up in that bunch of
hair, he must know how to aim allfired straight with his knife
and fork.</p>

<p>When I cum to look round there were more than a dozen chaps,
rale dandy-looking fellers, with their lips bristled out in the same
way. Think sez I, there are some men that would be hogs if they
only had bristles, as we say in Connecticut, but these chaps
needn't keep out of the gutters for want of them, they are ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61] </a></span>for sarvice any time. There were two or three ruther good-looking
chaps, that didn't let the hair grow on their upper lips,
but it come up in a pint like a letter A from the tip of the chins
eenamost to their mouths. These fellers had great hairy whiskers
that made them look as if they had run all to head like a
seed onion. I swanny, I never did see such a set of infarnal
looking coots in all my life&mdash;a tribe of ribbed nosed babboons
would have looked ten times as much like men; and yet they
did't seem the least bit ashamed of themselves, but strutted round
among the gals as large as life, showing off with their white
gloves on and white cambric handkerchers, that I s'pose they
borrowed from their sisters, stuck into their pockets.</p>

<p>I wouldn't go up and speak tu Miss Beebe till that ninnihammer
with the brustles went away from her, for I was afeard that
I couldn't hold in, but should haw haw right out in his face, if I
got tu looking at him too stiddy. I raly didn't know which looked
the worst, men running about among decent people with dirty
brustles under their noses, or women a trying tu make themselves
look humpbacked so as tu be in the fashion.</p>

<p>At last the chap with the brustles went off with a young gal
into the room where the bushes were, to look at the swarry, I
s'pose, and so then I went up tu Miss Beebe and I made a bow,
and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's a pleasant evening, Miss Beebe."</p>

<p>"Yes," sez she, "it is very pleasant."</p>

<p>I didn't seem tu stand easy, so I put t'other foot for'ard, and
wiped my nose a little with my red hankercher.</p>

<p>"Any news a stirring?" sez I.</p>

<p>"Nothing particular that I know on," sez she.</p>

<p>I changed feet agin.</p>

<p>"I ruther thought it was a going tu rain, but I guess it won't
now," sez I.</p>

<p>"No, I ruther think not," sez she.</p>

<p>We stood stock still a minit, and then I put my hankercher in
my coat pocket agin, and, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swanny, Miss Beebe, you've got a grist of harnsome gals
here to-night. I'll be darned if I aint eenamost in love with
some one on 'em."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62] </a></span></p>
<p>"I'm sure you ought to be," says she, a puckering up her
mouth, "you don't know how much they have been a talking
about you. I declare you've got to be quite a lion since you took
to writing, cousin Slick."</p>

<p>"A what?" sez I.</p>

<p>"A literary lion," sez she, with one of her old Weathersfield
smiles.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "that's a queer name, but I don't care what they
call me, if they don't call me late tu dinner."</p>

<p>Jest that minit a tall harnsome young feller cum up to us, and
Miss Beebe turned tu him and spoke softly, with her eyes half
shet, jest as if she was a dying off, and she asked him if he
wouldn't sing.</p>

<p>With that he puckered up his mouth and said he couldn't,
cause he'd got such a bad cold; but anybody that had his eye
teeth cut might have seen that he only wanted her tu coax him.
A lot of young gals crowded round and begun tu put the soft
sodder over him.</p>

<p>"Oh du&mdash;now pray du," sez one, and the rest on 'em took it
up till the poor feller, he didn't know which eend his head was
on. So he sot down and flung back his head with his eyes half
shet, and he began tu sing. I swanny, it eenamost made the
tears cum into my eyes tu hear him, it was rale ginuine music;
but the very minit he begun, the young gals that had been
a teasing him so tu sing, went on a talking and a larfin, as if he
hadn't done what they wanted. I raly felt sorry for the feller;
yit he didn't seem tu mind it, but sung away as if everybody was
a listening.</p>

<p>Jest then, cousin Beebe called out my name from t'other side
the room. I wish you could a seen how they all stared; it
warn't more than ten minits arter that, afore eenamost every one
in there was at cousin Beebe tu be introduced tu me&mdash;the fellers
with the brustles and all. The purtyest gals in the room kept a
flocking round me as if they'd never seen a man that wrote for
the newspapers afore. Talk about soft sodder&mdash;there's nobody
on arth can put it into a chap so smooth as a harnsome gal. Somehow
they melt it with their smiles, till it sinks through his heart
afore he knows it. I was talking with a rale peeler of a gal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63] </a></span>with two of the brightest black eyes that I ever see, when somebody
struck up a tune on the pianner-forty, and two or three
couple got onto the floor as if they wanted tu dance.</p>

<p>"Do you dance quadrills, Mr. Slick?" sez the black eyed gal,
as if she wanted me tu ask her to dance.</p>

<p>"Wal, I don't know," sez I, "I never tried them kind of things;
but I ruther guess I can, if you'll show me how."</p>

<p>With that, I took the tip eend of her white glove between the
fingers of my yaller one, and went with her into the middle of
the room. I didn't know what they were a going tu dance, but
I warn't much afeard, anyhow&mdash;for there warn't a chap in all
Weathersfield could beat me at a double shuffle, or could cut so
neat a pigeon-wing without music, as I could.</p>

<p>Wal, the music begun, and one of the fellers that had the hair
on his lip, begun tu slide about with his eyes half shet and his
hands a hanging down, and looking as doleful as if he'd jest come
away from a funeral. Did you ever see a duck swim a mill-dam,
or a hen turning up its eyes when it's a drinking? If you have
you can git some idea how the lazy coot danced. I thought I
should go off the handle tu see him, but the gals all stuck out
their little feet, and poked about jest in the same way. Think
sez I, when it comes my turn, I'll give you a little specimen of
ginuine dancing. I only wish I thought tu put a little loose
change in my pocket tu jingle, if it was only jest tu show how
well I keep step.</p>

<p>A young lady, with her hair twisted all up with little white
flowers, balanced up tu me, jest as you've seen a bird walk, and
then it come my turn. I took two steps for'ard and then I cut
a peeler of a pigeon-wing, and ended off with a little touch of
the double shuffle, but my trousers was so plaguy tight that I
couldn't make my legs rale limber all I could du, besides, the
music warn't much more like a dancing tune than Greenbank or
Old Hundred. At last I went up tu the gal that was playing,
and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a here&mdash;jest give us something lively&mdash;Yankee Doodle,
or Money Muss, or the Irish Washerwoman, or Paddy Carey. I
aint a going tu twist and pucker round in this way."</p>

<p>With that the young fellers with the hair lips begun tu push
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64] </a></span>their cambric hankerchers into their mouths, and the young gals
puckered up their mouths as if I'd done something tu poke fun
at. But instid of sneaking off and letting the stuck up varmints
think they'd scared me so I darsn't dance, I felt my dander a getting
up, and sez I tu myself, "I guess I'll let 'em see that I warn't
brought up in the woods to be scared at owls, any how;" so I
jest turned tu the black eyed gal that was my partner, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Cum now, Miss, let us show 'em how it's done," and with
that I begun tu put it down right and left like a streak of lightning.
It warn't more than two minits afore I heard the gals a
talking tu each other, and a saying,</p>

<p>"How odd&mdash;how strange&mdash;quite the eccentricity of genius&mdash;these
literary lions never do anything as other people do!&mdash;I
don't wonder Miss Beebe's proud of him."</p>

<p>The young fellers joined in and stopped larfin as quick as could
be, the minit they begun to see how the wind was a blowing up
in my quarter, and when I finished off and led the black eyed
gal tu one of the footstools, there was no eend tu the soft sodder
they all put on tu me. Sez I tu myself, nothing like keeping a
stiff upper lip with these stuck up fashionables, for arter all they
aint more than half sartin what's genteel and what aint.</p>

<p>Jest then the music begun agin, and one of them tall hairy
lipped fellers got up with a purty little gal, that didn't look more
than eighteen years old, and he put his white gloves on a little
tighter, and then I'll be darned if he didn't begin to hug her
right there afore all on us. He put one arm round her little
waist jest above the hump on her back, and he took one of her
hands in his'n, and then she looked up into his eyes and he
looked down into hers as loving as two pussy cats, and then they
begun to make cheeses on the carpet till you couldn't have told
which was which.</p>

<p>I never felt my blood bile so in all my life; it raly didn't seem
decent, and if she had been a relation of mine, I'll be darned to
darnation if I wouldn't have knocked that pesky varmint into a
cocked hat in less than no time. I'd a made him glad to eat
himself up hair and all, greasy as it must a tasted, tu have got
out of my way. Oh! but I was wrathy with the coot for a minit;
and then says I to myself, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65] </a></span>"I don't know as the chap's so much
to blame, arter all, it's the gal's own fault; if she likes to be
hugged and whirled round so afore the folks, the feller must be
an allfired fool not to like it as much she does; but, thinks I, if
the gal means to git married, her bread will be all dough agin,
arter this, for no decent honest man would want to marry a gal
arter he'd seen her tousled about afore fifty people, by such a
shote as that chap is."</p>

<p>As soon as the two critters sot down, the fellers and the gals
all locked arms and begun to stream out of the room. I thought
I might as well see where they were a going, so I jest crooked
my arm, and the black eyed gal put hers through it, and out we
went into the entry way tu a room further back, where all the
company was standing about round a table sot out with everything
good on arth that a feller ever thought of eating.</p>

<p>I thought the table, when I eat dinner at cousin John's, took
the shine off from everything that I'd ever seen afore in my life,
but it warn't a circumstance to this. There was no eend to the
silver dishes and baskets all sot out with flowers, and a running
over with bunches of white grapes and oranges, and everything
else good that ever grew on arth! and there were more than
half a dozen little steeples, all made out of red and white sugar
candy, hung over with flowers and curlecued about with little
sugar images, and sich lots of cake, and presarves, and jelly, and
things that I'd never seen afore in my life. Everything glittered
and shone so it fairly took away my appetite. There was another
little table kivered over with decanters and with a lot of them
cider bottles that I've told you about, standing on it; but I
kept purty clear of that, I can tell you. Cousin Beebe cum to
me with one of 'em in his hand, and sez he, sort of larfin,</p>

<p>"Come, cousin Slick, take a glass."</p>

<p>Says I, "No, if you'd jest as lives, I'd a little ruther not, your
York cider don't agree with me."</p>

<p>"Oh," sez he, "it's only sham pain, try a little."</p>

<p>"I'm jest as much obliged to you, but I'd a little ruther not, it
warn't sham pain that I had in my head the day arter I drunk it
before, I can tell you."</p>

<p>With that cousin Beebe larfed, and sez he, "you must be gallant,
and help Miss Miles, she hasn't got no refreshments yit." I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66] </a></span>looked toward the black eyed gal, and sure enough, there she
stood as mute as could be, looking on, while all the rest was a
eating. I went up to her again, and I made her a bow, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Miss Miles, what will you take? arter you is manners for me,
and I begin to feel a little as if I should like a bite."</p>

<p>I could see that tarnal purty mouth of hern begin to tremble,
as if it wanted to say something funny, but she looked in my
face, and sez she,</p>

<p>"I'll take a little blue monge if you please."</p>

<p>I didn't know what she could mean, but there was some stuff
in some little blue glasses, that looked as much like soap suds as
anything else, and I took one of 'em out of the silver thing that it
stood in, and I jest stirred it up a little with the spoon, afore I give
it to her. I dont know what on arth become of the blue monge,
but I hadn't more than touched it when off it went, and left
the glass eenajest empty. Miss Miles larfed a little, and says she,</p>

<p>"Thank you, the syllabub will do jest as well. A few grapes,
and a trifle of that jelly, if you please."</p>

<p>"But," sez I, holding the glass, and a lookin down on the
carpet and over my new trousers, "where on arth can that monge
have gone tu! I hope there aint none of it got on tu your silk
frock, Miss Miles."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," sez she, "don't mind it, the grapes will do jest as
well."</p>

<p>I took up a plate and gave her a great whopping bunch from
off one of the dishes, and then I made another bow, and, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Anything else, Miss Miles? I'd do anything on arth to
oblige you."</p>

<p>She twisted up that plump little mouth of hern in one of the
handsomest smiles I ever see, and, sez she, "I'll take that rose
bud that dropped from the grape basket when you took these out."</p>

<p>I swan, but she looked plaguy harnsome, I couldn't but jest
keep from staring right in her face all the time. I felt my heart
a floundering about, like a pullet with its neck twisted, when
she said this, and I took up the rose bud between the fingers of
my yaller gloves, and I stepped back and made as genteel a bow
as I could, considering I hadn't room to square my elbows, and,
sez I&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67] </a></span></p>
<p>"I hope you'll keep that ere to remember me by."</p>

<p>She gave me another of them tarnation bright smiles, and she
stuck the rose in her bosom, and sez she, kinder larfin a little&mdash;</p>

<p>"What shall I give you, Mr. Slick? This myrtle sprig? it'll
keep green longer than your rose."</p>

<p>"No thank you," sez I, a looking at her as killing as could be,
"I'll take it; but I don't want anything to make me remember
you."</p>

<p>I kinder expected that she'd have blushed a little when I said
that; but somehow these city gals don't color up very easy. She
smiled again, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Slick, you must call and see how well your rose
keeps with me. Mrs. Beebe, will come with you any time."</p>

<p>Sez I, "but I aint sartin as you'll be glad to see me, you must
have a great many beaus, and I may be in the way."</p>

<p>She was a going to answer me, but jest then that tarnal varmint
with the hair come up with a plate in his hand, and sez he&mdash;"Let
me help you tu a jelly, Miss Miles."</p>

<p>I could have knocked the critter into the middle of next week,
I was so tarnal mad; but there he stood a bowing and a smiling
through his hair lip like an etarnal monkey that had got the
stomach ache, and I couldn't get a word in edge ways. I couldn't
eat a morsel, but I took up one of the cider bottles without a
thinking what I was a doing, and I drunk two glasses right off,
and arter that I felt a little better; but I'll be darned if it didn't
make me grit my teeth tu see that stuck-up coot work his arm
as if he warnted to go into t'other room with Miss Miles. She
looked round as if to see where I was, and then I went right
straight up, and, sez I tu him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arter <em>me</em> is manners for <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>With that I took her little hand in my yaller glove, and I put
it into my arm as genteel as could be, and walked straight into
t'other room with her. She sot down on one of the settees, and
I jest pulled one of the footstools close up to her, and there we
both sot as sociable as could be till the folks all come back agin.
Arter that I had to git up and give a pale-looking gal my seat;
but I kept a standing up by the eend of the settee, till Cousin
Beebe come up tu me, and, sez he&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68] </a></span></p>
<p>"Cousin Slick, jest step this way a minit."</p>

<p>He went right between the silk winder curtins into the place
where the bushes, and the birds, and the swarry was, and sez
he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin Jonathan, did you know that the straps to your pantaloons
have slipped out from under you boots?"</p>

<p>"You don't say so," sez I, a looking down at hisen, tu see how
he fixed them, for I didn't want him to think that I'd left 'em so
on purpose; but I felt awful streaked when I see his was buttoned
under the sole of his dancing pumps.</p>

<p>"Here, jest lift up your foot," sez he.</p>

<p>I histed my foot up, and he jirked the strops down quick
enough; but I swan if I didn't feel as if he'd corded me up tu see
how long I'd keep. I didn't wonder the chaps sidled and wriggled
about so when they tried tu dance, a feller couldn't take a
regular strong step tu save his life, girt up in a pair of these new-fashioned
trousers.</p>

<p>"Look a here, cousin Beebe," sez I, jest as he was a going out,
and I pinted tu the naked marble woman a standing among the
bushes, with the light a coming in from t'other room onto her,
till she looked like a harnsome ghost a walking among the
bushes by moonlight; "if you'll take a fool's advice you'll buy a
frock and petticoat for that purty swarry of yourn, afore you
have another party. How should you feel if some of them young
gals was tu cum in here?"</p>

<p>John bust out a larfin, and I raly thought the critter would
never stop.</p>

<p>"Now what are you a haw-hawing about?" sez I, sort a
wrathy, "because I cum here with my trousers slipped up a
leetle. I don't s'pose anybody but you see them."</p>

<p>"Oh never think about it," sez he, a biting in, but the tears
kept a running down his cheeks, for all that. "If they did see
it, they'll set it down for the eccentricity of genius, as the young
ladies say. You literary chaps can do a'most anything now-a-days."</p>

<p>"I begin to think we can," sez I, for jest that minit I remembered
all that tarnal sweet critter, Miss Miles, had been a saying
to me, and I looked down tu see if the sprig of myrtle was in my
button-hole yit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69] </a></span></p>
<p>When we went into the room, there warn't scarce any of the
party left. I stood by one of the doors till I saw Miss Miles cum
down with her purty face half buried up in a great silk hood&mdash;so
I jest went with her to the door, and there stood a carriage with
a nigger a standing by the door&mdash;so I jest took hold of her hand
and helped her to git in; and arter that I felt so lonesome, I bid
cousin Mary good night and made tracks for my office. I ruther
think I won't tell what I dreamed about&mdash;you old steady folks do
love to larf at a young chap so&mdash;and as I ruther think I shall
cum hum tu thanksgiving, I don't mean to let you all poke too
much fun at me.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Scenes in Broadway&mdash;Jonathan's Interview with the Count and
Flirtations with Miss Miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>I am eenamost sartin that you was disappinted because I didn't
come hum to thanksgiving, but somehow I couldn't raise pluck
enough to start, all I could du. I raly don't know what seemed
to be the matter with me; but arter Miss Beebe's party, I begun
to git as peaked and wamblecropped as could be. I swanny, if
it didn't set me all in a fluster the next morning, when I got up
and found the sprig of myrtle that Miss Miles give me a lying on
the floor jest where it had dropped from the button hole of my
new coat.</p>

<p>I didn't hardly give myself time to put on my clothes, afore I
went out to a crockeryware stand and bought a tumbler to put
it in; and then I set it on my desk, and tried to write a little, for
I didn't feel jest like eating any breakfast. But it warn't of no
use trying&mdash;all I could du, every idee in my head got fixed on
the myrtle, and Miss Miles, and the party. I didn't write two
words together, but scrabbled all over the paper, and figgered out
little heads, and meeting-houses, and hay-stacks on it, as nat'ral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70] </a></span>as could be; but if I'd been hung and choked to death, I couldn't
a wrote two rale ginuine lines. I felt sort of odd all over, and I
hadn't the least notion what could ail me; it warn't a very
tedious feeling, though, but it seemed as if I was a dreaming yit,
and all about that tarnation little Miss Miles. I kept a seeing
them bright black eyes and them long curls of hern all the time,
as plain as day. I'll be choked if I didn't git afeared that I was
a beginning to have a kind of a sneakin notion arter her, and sez
I to myself, "Mr. Jonathan Slick, this won't do no how. Arter
what you've seen of woman natur in that Judy White, you must
be a darned crazy shote to poke your fingers in that fire agin."
But a feller may as well drink tu much lickor and ask it not to
make him stagger, as to git his head chock full of the gals and
then try to talk common sense to hisself. It is like giving advice
to a rat when his leg is in the trap.</p>

<p>The long and short of it was, I couldn't set still, and I couldn't
think of anything on arth but that gal, so I jumped up all tu
once and sez I to myself&mdash;"Wal, one way or t'other, by hook or
by crook, I'll see her agin&mdash;I will, by hokey! it's of no use to
git down in the mouth about it, she can't do more than give me
the mittin, any how, and it will be the first gal I ever got it from,
if she does, I can tell her that."</p>

<p>I was so anxious that it seemed forever afore I got on my dandy
coat and trousers agin. My hankercher smelt purty strong yit
of the essence of peppermint, so I fixed it right in my pocket,
put on my yaller gloves, and stuck the sprig of myrtle in my
bosom afore I gin the last peak into the leetle looking-glass that
hangs in a corner of my office. I don't think there could be
much said agin my looks, as I went down Cherry street with my
head flung back, sort of independent, and the tip eend of my
yaller gloves stuck in my pocket. Consarn that Broadway
tailor! he made the trousers so tight that I couldn't get a hull
hand in no more than I could fly.</p>

<p>Miss Miles lives clear up to the further eend of Broadway, so
I took a short cut across the Park, and went along by the Astor
House. A lot of dandyfied looking chaps stood on the steps a
staring at the harnsome gals as they went by, all furbelowed and
finefied out like a stream of garden flowers all in full blow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71] </a></span></p>
<p>They may talk about England and France and Garmany, as
well as all the other big places that a feller can pint out on the
map; but, for my part, I don't believe there is a place on the
arth where the wimmen dress so allfired costly as they du here
in York. It raly is enough to make a feller grit his teeth to see
the harnsome critters sideling and curchying along the stun walks,
wrapped up in silks and satins and velvets, and all sorts of
feathers, as long as them that Captain Jones wore in his training
cap, as if it only wanted a fiddler to set them all a dancing, when
their husbands are out a shinning and working themselves to
death to keep their notes from being sued by the lawyers. It
don't seem right, but yit they do look tarnal killing in their furbelows&mdash;it's
of no use denying that.</p>

<p>But one thing did raise my dander a leetle as I went along,
that's a fact. Any body that had half an eye could see that all
the young gals were possessed after them foreign chaps with the
brustles and whiskers. Every once in a while one of the indecent
varmints would come along with his head twisted round under
some purty woman's bonnet, talking as soft and as mealy-mouthed
as could be, like an old grey cat mewing round a bird cage, and
the gals seemed all in a twitter, they were so tickled, and screwed
up their mouths, and smiled to show their teeth, and looked as
proud as peacocks of the etarnal impudent critters. I'll be
darned if I don't believe every one of them chaps are barbers or
chair-makers when they are to hum, and hearing what a chance
the York gals give every kind of animals that come from foreign
parts, and how they begin to turn up their noses at a rale true
born American, whenever they can git a chance to make fools
of themselves with them hairy lipp'd fellers, they've come over
here to York to court the gals and git up a new crop of hair to
begin bisness with when they git hum agin. Think sez I, it
wouldn't be a bad joke sometime about six months arter this, if
some of them same gals that don't think nothing of chasing arter
them fellers, should buy his whiskers and all the rest on 'em that
they fall in love with, stuffed into a footstool, sich as I saw at
Miss Beebe's. Stranger things than that has happened afore
now, I reckon.</p>

<p>It raly made me feel bad to see tall, harnsome-looking fellers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72] </a></span>ginuine Americans, with revolutionary blood in their hearts, a
standing on the tavern steps, and a walking all alone up and
down the streets as molancholy as mice in an empty mill, while
their own wimmen folks, that ought to feel ashamed of themselves,
were a talking and smiling and giggling with that pack of
varmints. It made my blood bile to see it, I can tell you.</p>

<p>You wont think it exactly like a Christian to run on as I du
about them fellers, I'm afeard; but the truth of it is, I <em>do</em> hate
'em like pison. If I owned a caravan of living animals, darn me,
if I wouldn't catch some on 'em for specimens, and cage 'em up
for a show. They wouldn't be a strutting up Broadway and a
showing themselves for nothing much longer, I can tell them
that! They talk about Yankee speculations; I reckon this would
be a prime one&mdash;wouldn't it? If a feller could only get a good
trap made, there wouldn't be no difficulty but we could find
purty gals&mdash;them that live in fine houses and hold up their heads
as if they were queens too&mdash;that would be willing enough to let
you use them for bate.</p>

<p>You wont be surprised that I am wrothy about them chaps when
I tell you how I was struck up jest arter I went by the Astor
House. I was thinking about one thing or another, when all to
once I lifted my head and there was Miss Miles a coming toward
me a looking as fresh and harnsome as a full blown butter cup,
and close to her side, that Count with the crabbed name that I
saw at Miss Beebe's was a twistifying himself along, with his
head bent sideways till the great long white feather that she wore
in her bonnet all but swept across his eyes. I eenamost felt as if I
should holler out, and I raly believe I should have boo hooed
right in the street if I hadn't been so allfired wrathy at the sight
of him. Oh! but my Yankee grit did rise&mdash;I dug my hands down
in my trousers' pocket and walked right straight up to them a
grinning like a hyena, for I was detarmined to let them see that
I didn't care a copper how much they walked together. They
were so busy twisting their heads about and a looking soft sodder
at each other that they didn't see me till I stood right afore them
as stiff as an iron crowbar, with my head up straight, and one foot
stuck out for'ard, as an independent and true born Yankee ought
to do when he sees himself imposed on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73] </a></span></p>
<p>There was no mistake in Miss Miles this time any how. She
gave a little scream and blushed as red as a turkey's comb, and
then she looked about sort of skeery as if she was afeard somebody
would see how slick I'd caught her. I was mad as all natur,
but as true as you live I couldn't but jest keep from haw hawing
right out to see how that hair lipp'd Count acted when he saw me
a standing up afore him. He kinder stepped back and stuck out
one foot a little sideways, jest as if he was a going to make a bow,
and he twisted his little stuck up waist round till his head poked
out like a mud turtle when he wants to see if anybody is near.
Then he took a thing out of his vest pocket hitched to a gold
chain that he wore round his neck, and held it up to one eye, and
there he stood a staring at me and twisting his face and a brustling
up his hair lip, like an etarnal monkey. I didn't seem to
mind him, but looked right straight at Miss Miles, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you du, Miss Miles?"</p>

<p>She didn't seem to know how to take me at first, so she looked
at the feller and then at me, and, arter a while, sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr Slick, is it you?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I ruther guess it is," sez I, "but I s'pose my room's as
good as my company, I don't want tu keep you from talking tu
your beau there."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Slick," sez she, a twisting up her mouth and a looking
in my face, jest as she did the night afore, "how odd you men of
genius are! The Count, I'm sure, will be happy to meet you,
won't you, Count?"</p>

<p>She called the coot by his hull name, but how she could twist
that little mouth of hern so as to git the word out, I can't tell.
Arter that she turned her head a little, and said something sort
of low to him. She smiled so harnsome, and her voice was so
soft and coaxing, that I had eenamost forgot the chap, but her
talking to him made me rile up agin&mdash;and jest as he was letting
that half of a pair of spectacles down from his eye, and was a
beginning to put his face ship shape agin, I walked right straight
up to him, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a here you chap, I ruther guess you mean to know who
I am the next time you see me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74] </a></span></p>
<p>"Sare?" sez he, a standing up straight and opening his great
black eyes till they seemed chuck full of fire and brimstone.</p>

<p>"Wal, what on it?" sez I.</p>

<p>"You are impertinent," sez he.</p>

<p>"Wal, now I reckon that aint what I was baptized. I'll tell
you what, Mr. Hair-lip, I haint a going to let you nor any body
else call me names," sez I, a taking both hands out of my trousers
pockets, and a pulling up my yaller gloves, as spiteful as could be,
jest to show him that my mawlers were fit for use.</p>

<p>The feller's lips began to grow white, but he twisted them up
as if he wanted to make me think he didn't care for what I said.</p>

<p>"Sare," sez he, "do you know whom you are speaking to?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, larfin in his face a leetle, "I ruther guess I du,
though I haint just made up my mind what kind of horned cattle
you call yourself yit: they give all sich stranger-critters a name,
and I s'pose you'll git one by-am-by, as well as the rest on 'em."</p>

<p>With that he turned as white as a tub of curd, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is too much, sare; remember you are speaking to a
Count." Here he out with a name as long and crooked as a
sassafras root.</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" sez I.</p>

<p>"I'm a nobleman!" sez he, and he was a going on to give me
another string of foreign jaw-breakers; but I jest sot down my
foot, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Look a here, you feller&mdash;I don't care the value of a butnut-shell
how many names you've got; we don't own no Counts in
this ere free land of liberty, but them that can count down the
most hard chink, and they have to work tarnation hard afore
they git the title, I can tell you. As for your noblemen, we
have raised a new-fashioned sort of 'em in this land of liberty.
In the Revolutionary War a hull grist on 'em sot their titles down
on our glorious Declaration of Independence, and there they'll
stay, as bright as the stars, to all etarnity, and a day longer. We
don't ask our noblemen who their fathers were, or how they got
a living. <em>Great deeds</em> and&mdash;what's the same thing&mdash;<em>good deeds</em>
make noblemen here. Every man has to work out his own title
and when he dies, instid of leaving it to some booby of a son, he
writes his date out in the history of his country, and takes it back
to him who gave the power to arn it. As for any other noblemen&mdash;though
I believe arter all that the true ginuine lords and counts
that come out here are as scarce as hen's teeth&mdash;" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75] </a></span>(here the count
didn't seem to stand easy,) "we <em>true</em> Americans, rale full-blooded
Yankees, don't care any more for their titles than we do for the
stuns under our feet. It's only your half-blooded Americans that
have been baked over in Europe, and our silly finefied gals that
chase after you. An honest straight for'ard Yankee gal would take
you for jest what you are worth as <em>men</em>, and when they du that,
I rather guess we can pull an even yoke with any of you that
come from t'other side the water."</p>

<p>Here I gave Miss Miles a squint that made her wilt like a broken
rose in the hot sun! "Mr. Slick," sez she, eenamost crying,
"I beg, I entreat, let us walk on. See how the people are
remarking us."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, sort of mollified, "I aint doing nothing to be
ashamed on, am I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," sez she, "I didn't mean to say that."</p>

<p>"Wal, there aint nothing on arth that I wont du to oblige a
harnsome critter like you," sez I, a going round to the other side
on her. She gave me another of her prime smiles, and that
seemed to pacify me. So we all three walked along together till
we got agin the Astor House once more. The Count looked as
sour as a vinegar barrel&mdash;I suppose, because I was detarmined
to hang on, but I kept a stiff upper lip, and marched down the
stun walk as straight as a bean pole stuck up on eend. Miss
Miles begun to smile agin, and she talked to him as sweet as
could be, but I couldn't make out a word she said, for she didn't
speak rale American, but every now and then, jest as I was beginning
to get rily about it, she would turn her face to me, and
pucker up her mouth so coaxing, that somehow I couldn't git
right down wrathy if I tried ever so much.</p>

<p>When the Count saw that I wasn't to be scared away, he jest
give me a good long stare right in the eyes, and then bending a
little for'ard to Miss Miles, he lifted his hat about an inch from
his head and went into the Astor House. I don't know what on
arth could be the matter, but the minit he left us I begun to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76] </a></span>as sheepish as could be. I didn't know what in nature to talk
about&mdash;so I jest took my red silk handkercher and gave it a flirt
out of my pocket, and then put it back agin.</p>

<p>"Do you like the smell of essence of peppermint, Miss Miles?"
sez I.</p>

<p>"I'm very fond of perfume," sez she.</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't like the stuff that are Count had on his
handkercher," sez I. "I swanny, it eenamost made me sick;
he smelt more like a musk-rat than anything else."</p>

<p>"You can't expect every body to have <em>your</em> taste in selecting
perfumes for his toilet, Mr. Slick," sez she, a puckering up her
mouth till it looked like a red clover top full of honey.</p>

<p>"I swow, Miss Miles, you look as harnsome as a full blown rose
this morning," sez I; "it aint a mite of wonder that I couldn't
sleep a bit last night."</p>

<p>With that I jest took a good squint at her as we went along,
for I couldn't think what to say next. I don't believe the things
she had on cost one cent less than fifty dollars, enough to rig out
all the gals in Weathersfield with boughten finery; her cloak was
the queerest thing I ever did see; it only reached jest down to
her knees, and was made out of rale silk velvet. I know it was
silk, for I jest slipped off my yaller glove, and felt on it to be sartin,
as we walked along. It was kinder purply, like the damsons
that grow in our corn lot, and was loaded down with some kind
of long fur. Under that she wore another dress of black silk velvet,
that shone in the sun like a crow's back. The cloak had
great open sleeves, edged with fur, a hanging round her arms;
and I could see the corner of a hankercher a sticking out from
the eend of her little black muff jest enough to show how harnsomely
it was figger'd off; a bunch of red flowers was stuck agin
each side of her face under her bonnet, and her eyes looked bright,
and her cheeks rosy enough to make a feller catch his breath.
The more I looked at her, the more uneasy I got about that
Count. I wanted to say something to her about him dreadfully,
but some how I didn't know what to say first. I took out my
hankercher agin, and then I wiped my nose and put it back; then
I begun to examine the fingers of my yaller gloves, to see how
they stood the weather. Finally, I lost step, and it took me three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77] </a></span>minits to get the right hitch agin; at last I bust right out, and,
sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Miles, between you and I and the post, jest tell me
do you raly care anything about that are Count?"</p>

<p>She turned her roguish black eyes to my face, and, sez she,
"Why, Mr. Slick, how can you ask sich a question?"</p>

<p>"Now that's Yankee all over," sez I, "you aint told me yet:
only asked me another question to match mine."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know for?" sez she, sort of softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, not much of anything; I should kinder like to know,
that's all," sez I. With that, think sez I, I'll try and make her
jealous a leetle, and sez I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Miles, that they've been a printing my
picter clear off in Michigan and down in Cincinnati? I guess I
shall go out there one of these days and see how I like the folks
out West, I begin to git eenamost tired of York." I warn't
wrong; that brought her to her senses purty quick.</p>

<p>"You don't really intend to leave the city," sez she, a looking
at me as arnest as could be.</p>

<p>"Wal, I don't know," sez I, "them Western editors want me
to come dreadfully. One on 'em sent me word that they had a
grist of harnsome gals in his State."</p>

<p>"Is the picter out West so very well painted?" sez she.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "it's a purty good likeness, considering it was
took in my old clothes," (and with that I took out the paper and
I showed it to her). "I ruther think it will be best for me to go
on there," sez I, a putting up the picter; "that are Count will
think I want to cut him out, I'm afeard."</p>

<p>I looked straight at her as I said this, but she begun to smooth
down the fur on her muff with her little hand, and when she did
speak I had to bend my head down to hear what she was a
saying.</p>

<p>Afore I could make out what she meant to say, a couple of
harnsome young gals cum along and they stopped as if they were
tickled to death to see her; I thought there warn't much chance
for me to git another word in edgeways; so I cut for the office
and left them a talking as they went along.</p>

<p>Think sez I, as I was a going along through the Park, arter all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78] </a></span>human natur is purty much the same in all places. I don't see
as there's much difference between our gals there in Weathersfield,
that wear calico frocks and straw bonnets, and these York
tippies that go out all furbelowed off in their silks and satins.
They are six of one and half a dozen of t'other the world over.
If it hadn't been for that are Count I should not have been much
at a loss to know how to take Miss Miles. When a gal begins to
talk down her throat, and fingers her muff as she did, it's a purty
sure symptom that there'll be a change of weather in her heart
afore long, but somehow that tarnal Count, consarn him, put me
all out on my natural reckoning. But who cares? sez I to
myself. I'll bet a cookey if there warn't but two men in the
world, and them were that darned feller and Jonathan Slick, and
she'd got to marry one or t'other, she wouldn't be long a making
up her mind whether to take a chap for what he's got in his
head or for the hair that grows outside on it; for a gal with half
an eye might see that when a feller's brains all run to hair, he
can't have much sense left.</p>

<p>But when these fellers are so chased after by all the gals, there
is no saying what kind of a chance a plain, honest chap like me
might have among 'em. But any how, I'll try my luck to-morrow,
for if I don't go tu see her I shall be sick abed, that's
sartin.</p>

<p class="chaphead">The Morning Call&mdash;A Coquette's Dressing Room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>Arly the next morning, I got up and put on my new clothes
agin, and sot afore the fire, thinking of eenamost every thing on
arth, till the clock struck nine; then I slicked down my hair a
leetle, and pulled foot up Broadway agin. I kinder expected
every minit that I should meet Miss Miles, as I did yesterday;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79] </a></span>but somehow there didn't seem tu be any body a stirring. There
warn't a single one of them whiskered chaps in sight, and all the
women-folks that I could see, up or down, seemed tu have on
nothing but their everyday clothes. I saw tew or three rale
homespun, modest-looking young critters, but they warn't dressed
up, and some on 'em were a carrying band-boxes and sich things
afore them. Once I got allfired wrathy, for a nigger woman
stood out on the stun side-walk with a great long brush in her
hand, a scrubbing the winders of a big house with it; and jest as
I come along, she give the brush a flourish, and sent a hull
thunder-shower of dirty water all over my new clothes.</p>

<p>"You etarnal black nigger, you! you'd better look out, and
keep your soap-suds for them that wants washing," sez I.</p>

<p>But she hee-he'd out a larfin, and begun tu brush away agin
jest as if I hadn't said a word tu her. Think sez I, it wouldn't
be jest the thing for any body tu see me a jawing here with a
nigger wench, so I may as well grin and bear it, for I don't know
of anything that proves a feller a leetle soft in the garret, so
much as keeping up a quarrel with a person that is so much
beneath him that there aint nothing tu be gained, though you du
git the upper hand. So I choked in, and took out my hankercher
and wiped off my coat-sleeves, and went along; but it warn't no
easy matter tu navigate so as not tu git a second ducking, for
every nigger in York seemed to be out a washing winders. I
come near slipping up tew or three times, the stuns were so wet
afore all the housen. I can tell you what, this going tu make
morning calls ain't no joke, especially if a feller happens tu be
dressed up. The niggers will sponge his coat for him, if the
tailor forgot tu, without charging him for the trouble.</p>

<p>Jest afore I got up tu the great four-story house where Miss
Miles lives, I begun to feel sort of anxious agin. Think sez I,
what on arth shall I say tu her when I du get there? So I kept
a thinking over a capital leetle speech that I meant tu make.
I'd read in story-books about lovers that always went down on
their knees when they talked soft sodder to sich stuck-up gals as
Miss Miles; but tu save my life, I couldn't make up my mouth
to it; the gal must be something more than common flesh and
blood that would ever bring Jonathan Slick on his marrow bones,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80] </a></span>I'm thinking; so if she calculates that I'm a going to make such
a mean coot of myself as that, why she may go to grass for
what I care.</p>

<p>Besides, sez I tu myself, how on arth would I kneel down in
these new-fashioned trousers, if I wanted tu ever so much; when
arter putting one thing and another together, I made up my
mind that kneeling down tu the gals must have gone out of
fashion here in York when the chaps give up wearing them
trousers puffed in at the waistbands. This kinder made my mind
easy on that point; so I went on thinking over what I should
say tu Miss Miles when I got tu her house.</p>

<p>Now it ain't no ways hard to make first-rate speeches up in a
feller's head, when he's a going tu see a gal that he's a beginning
tu take a shine arter; but somehow the worst on it all is, a chap
al'ers forgets every word on it when he comes where the gal is.</p>

<p>I begun to grow awful uneasy jest afore I got to the house,
and my heart sot to beating in my bosom, like the pestle in an
old fashioned samp mortar. It seemed to me as if somebody
was a looking arter me, and as if they knew that I was going a
courting in broad daylight, which was enough to make any
decent chap look sheepish that had never thought of making up
to the gals only on a Sunday night arter dark, when these things
seem to come nat'ral.</p>

<p>Wal, when I got agin the house, I took a squint up to the
winders, for I thought mebby Miss Miles would be a looking out;
but there warn't nobody to be seen, so I went up the wide marble
steps, that looked as white as snow, with a great chunk of
marble a curling down each side on 'em, and there I stood stock
still, for my heart floundered about so that it eenamost choked
me, and if I'd been hung I couldn't a got up pluck to pull the
silver knob and make somebody come and let me in; for all the
York people keep their doors fastened in the day time, so that if
a feller's in ever so much of a hurry, he's got to stand out doors
till a nigger comes to let him in.</p>

<p>By-am-by a black gal stuck her head up from under the steps,
as if she was a going tu speak; so I turned my back to the door,
and stuck both hands in my pockets and began to whistle, as independent
as could be, jest to let her see that I didn't feel anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81] </a></span>to get in. Arter that I went down the steps agin, jest giving a
leetle touch of Yankee Doodle, sort of easy, as I walked up and
down on the stun walk afore the house, a trying to git up courage.
At last a gal come to the door with a tin basin in her hands, and
begun to scour the silver knobs so; I jest went right up the steps
agin like a house a fire, and sez I to the gal&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is Miss Miles tu hum?"</p>

<p>She kinder stared at me, as if she was a going to ask what I
wanted, but I warn't a going to stand there a talking to her, so
I jest pushed ahead, and went into the entry way. There warn't
nobody there, but one of the mahogany doors that opened on
one side was wide open, and I went in.</p>

<p>If any thing, the two great rooms was more harnsome than
them at Cousin Beebe's: the footstools and the settees and the
chairs were all kivered with shiny red velvet, figgered off like all
natur; but they stood about over the carpet every which way.
Two or three little stun tables stood out in the middle of the
room; one on 'em was kivered with decanters and wine glasses,
and some of the books lay all kivered with gold, a glittering and
shining on the carpet. The grates were all lined with solid silver,
but there warn't a spark of fire in either on 'em yit, and the
ashes lay all scattered out over the stun hearths as thick as could
be. A part of the great silk winder curtains were hitched up,
and the rest on 'em fell clear down to the floor over the winders,
till the sunshine that come a pouring through them looked as
light and red as a hundred glasses full of currant wine. Thinks
I, what on arth has become of all the folks? One would think
that they hadn't eat breakfast yit, by the looks of things; yit
that couldn't be, for by that time it was eenamost ten o'clock,
and any body that has the least idee of gitting a living won't
wait arter six for his breakfast.</p>

<p>Wal, arter wandering about the rooms a good while, I went
into the entry way agin; by that time the gal that I'd seen at
the door had got up on a chair, and was a hauling down a great
round glass thing, which was hung by a sort of chain up to the
ruff of the entry. When she see me a coming out of the two
rooms, she yelled out as if she didn't know that I was there
afore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82] </a></span></p>
<p>"What do you want here?" sez she, as imperdent as could be.</p>

<p>"Hold your tarnal yop, you critter you," sez I, "and jest tell
me where Miss Miles is; I've come to make her a morning call."</p>

<p>The gal seemed a leetle mortified by that, and sez she to a leetle
stuck up cuffy boy that cum up stairs jest then, "Here's a gentleman
wants to see Miss Miles&mdash;is she up yet?"</p>

<p>Wal, now, think sez I, if this York aint the beatumest place
that ever I did see&mdash;there aint a nigger in it but what's a poking
fun at you or a throwing water or some tarnal thing or
another. I wonder if these leetle coots think I'm soft enough to
believe that an honest, harnsome gal like Miss Miles, lies abed till
ten o'clock. They don't stuff me up that way, any how, if I did
come from the country.</p>

<p>"What name shall I take up?" sez the teinty cuffy, a bowing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haint partic'lar," sez I; "you may take up any you
like best&mdash;but I wish you'd jest tell me where she is, for I begin
to feel eenamost tuckered out, a walking and a standing round
here."</p>

<p>The leetle cuffy looked at the gal, and then they both begun
to giggle and tee-hee like any thing.</p>

<p>"Look a here, you damination copper colored image you," sez
I to the nigger, "jest you step up this minit if you don't want
to git an allfired thrashing!"</p>

<p>The poor leetle varmint looked scared out of a year's growth,
and sez he, as humble as could be, "Who shall I say wants to
see Miss Miles?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind that," sez I, "go ahead, and I guess she
won't be long a finding out."</p>

<p>With that the nigger went up stairs, and I arter him full
chisel; he looked round as if he wanted to say something jest as
he stopped by a door in the upper entry way; but I told him to
go ahead and hold his yop, for I warn't a going to wait any
longer. So he rapped at the door and somebody said, "Come
in." My heart riz in my throat, for I knew whose voice it was,
and I begun to feel as if I'd pitched head for'ard into a mill dam.
The cuffy opened the door, and sez he, "Ma'am here's a gentleman
that would come up."</p>

<p>I heard somebody give a leetle scream, and with that I jest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83] </a></span>pushed the nigger out of the way, and sez I, "Miss Miles, how
du you du?"</p>

<p>I sniggers, if I didn't raly pity the poor gal, she looked so
struck up in a heap; but what on arth made her act so I couldn't
tell at fust, for I felt kinder streaked as if I'd done something that
wasn't exactly right, though I couldn't think what, and it was as
much as a minit afore I looked right in her face. But jest as I
lifted up my head, and drew up my foot, arter making one of my
fust cut bows, she stood jest afore me. By the living hokey, I
never was so struck up in my born days! You know what I've
told you about Miss Miles, about her plump round form, her red
lips, and her rosy cheeks. Well, I'll be darned if there was one
of them left&mdash;I shouldn't have known her no more than nothing,
if it hadn't been for her eyes and the way she spoke. Her neck
and for'ard that always looked so white and harnsome, when I see
her at Cousin Mary's, and in Broadway, was as yaller as a safron
bag. There warn't the least mite of red in her face, and her
hair was all frizzley, and done up in a leetle bunch, about as big
as a hen's egg behind! She had on a great loose awk'ard-looking
gown, that made her seem twice as chunked as she used to, and
that looked more like a man's shirt cut long and ruffled round
than any thing else. It warn't any too clean neither, and both
her leetle shoes were down to the heel.</p>

<p>There I stood a looking at her with all the eyes in my head&mdash;my
foot was drawed up tight, and my arms were a hanging
straight down, jest as they swung back arter I'd made my bow.
I kinder seemed tu feel that my mouth was open a leetle, and
that I was a staring at her harder than was manners for me.
But if you'd a given me the best farm in all Weathersfield, I
couldn't have helped it, I was so struck up in a heap at seeing her
in sich a fix. I guess it was as much as two minits afore either
on us said a word; and, at last, Miss Miles turned to the nigger
as savage as a meataxe, and, sez she,</p>

<p>"Why didn't you show Mr. Slick into the drawing room?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't seem to mind it," sez I a walking into the room,
and a setting down on a chair with my hat between my knees,
"I'd jest as livs set up here as any where."</p>

<p>She looked as if she'd burst right out a crying, but at last she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84] </a></span>sot down and tried to act as if she was glad to see me. She
begun to make excuses about herself and the room, and said she
wasn't very well that morning, that she took a new book, and
sot down jest as she was to read it.</p>

<p>"Oh," sez I, "don't make no excuses; it aint the fust time
that I've ketched a gal in the suds. Marm used to say that she
never looked worse than common that somebody wasn't sartin
to drop in."</p>

<p>"Will you excuse me one instant, Mr. Slick," sez she, a minit
arter I'd said this, and a looking down on her awk'ard dress, as
if she couldn't help but feel streaked yit.</p>

<p>"Sartinly," sez I; "don't make no stranger of me."</p>

<p>With that, she opened the door and went into a room close by.
I jest got a good peak into it as she went through the door, and
an allfired harnsome room it was. There was a great mahogany
bedstead a standing in the middle, with a high goose feather bed
on it, kivered all over with a white quilt and great square pillows
all ruffled off, and the winder curtains were part white and part
sort of indigo blue. I couldn't git a chance to see what else
there was, she shut the door so quick. "By gracious," sez I to
myself, arter she went out, "who on arth would ever have
thought that Miss Miles was so old. When I saw her yesterday,
I'd a took my Bible oath that she warn't more than eighteen,
but now I'll be choked if she don't look as ancient as the
hills. If ever she sees thirty agin she'll have to turn like a
crab and walk backwards five or six years." What puzzled me
most was how in creation she contrived to look so young&mdash;but it
warn't a great while afore I made it out as clear as one of Deacon
Sykes' exhortations. Arter she'd gone out I jest got up and
took a sort of survey of the room; everything was t'other eend
up, helter skelter in it; there was no eend to the finery and
harnsome furniture, but it don't make much odds how extravagant
one is a laying out money if things aint kept neat and snug
in their places. The more things cost, the more it seems to hurt
a feller's feelings to see them flung about topsy turvy, as they
were in that room. I ruther think she didn't have her company
up there very often&mdash;but a gal that's got a good bringing up will
be jest as particular about the place she keeps for herself, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85] </a></span>which company never sees, as if it was likely to be seen every
day of her life.</p>

<p>I begun tu be allfired glad that I didn't ask her to have me
yesterday, for if she'd been as young as she seemed tu be, and as
harnsome as an angel, I wouldn't a had her arter seeing that
room of her'n. A pocket hankercher, worked and sprigged, and
ruffled off with lace, was a lying on the settee, but it was all
grimmed over with dirt, and looked as if it would a gin any
thing for a sight of the wash tub. The carpet was as soft and
thick as could be, and it was all kivered over with bunches of
posies as nat'ral as life; but there was a great grease spot close
by the fire, where somebody had upsot a lamp, and all around
the edges and in the corners it looked as if it hadn't been swept
for ever so long. A chest of drawers, solid, shiny mahogany&mdash;with
a great looking-glass, swung between two pieces of mahogany
on the top, stood on one side of the room, and there, a hanging
over the edge on 'em, as true as I live, were the long, harnsome
curls that I'd seen on Miss Miles when she was tu cousin Mary's
party! Wal, think sez I, if this don't take the rag off the bush!
What du you think I saw next? A glass tumbler about half full
of water, with three nice, leetle, white teeth a lying in the bottom
on it! I couldn't help but give a leetle whistle when I saw
them. Think sez I, it's jest as like as not that Miss Miles wont
pucker up her mouth and smile, quite so much this morning as
she did yesterday, any how.</p>

<p>There were two leetle china cups with the kivers a lying down
by them; one was filled with white stuff, kinder like flour, only
rather more gritty, and t'other was full of something that looked
as much like rose leaves ground down to powder as anything. A
leetle chunk of cotton wool was stuck into it, but what on arth
it was for, I couldn't make out. There were two or three silk
cushions chuck full of pins, on the drawers, and there was no
eend tu the leetle glass bottles all sprigged off with gold, a lying
round on the mantle-shelf, as well as on the tables and the chest
of drawers.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room there stood a great looking-glass, a
swinging between two leetle posts cut out of mahogany, and right
over it two silk frocks were tumbled up together. I begun to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86] </a></span>finger them a leetle, for somehow I felt curious tu know how the
tarnal cunning critter contrived tu make herself look so plump
and round. It didn't want much cyphering tu find her out. The
tops of her frocks, both on 'em, were all stuffed full of something
soft that made them stand out as nat'ral as life. I hadn't but
jest time tu drop the frock and set down agin&mdash;looking as
innocent as if butter wouldn't melt in my mouth&mdash;when Miss
Miles come back agin. She'd put on another frock, all ruffled
off, and somehow or other, had fixed up her hair so as to look
ruther more ship shape; but she hadn't had time to put herself
all together, though her face did look a leetle whiter than it did
when I fust went in. There warnt a bit of a hump on her back,
and she was nat'ral all the way round!</p>

<p>I felt ruther uneasy, for, think sez I, it's jest as like as not she'll
expect me to talk over a leetle soft sodder with her, as I did yesterday;
but I'll be darned if it don't make me sick tu think on it.
I hitched about on my chair, and I looked at every thing in the
room but her, then I took up my hat and begun to balance it on
my two fore fingers, and at last sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wal, Miss Miles, I s'pose I may as well be a jogging."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry," sez she, a trying tu smile, but without
opening her lips a bit, "I hope you won't make strangers
of us."</p>

<p>I let my hat drop, and picked it up again.</p>

<p>"What book was that that you've been a reading?" sez I, detarmined
tu say something.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the Countess of Blessington's last work," sez she;
"it's a charming book. Do you like her writings, Mr. Slick?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I don't know," sez I; "I never read any of her books, but
it kinder strikes me that she aint no great shakes herself, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, you shouldn't be censorious, Mr. Slick," sez she. "You
know Mr. Willis visited her and was delighted."</p>

<p>"Wal, now," sez I, "it's my opinion that Mr. N. P. Willis
couldn't be over hard to please, if a woman only had a title to her
name; but I wonder how on arth he contrived tu git so thick
with the quality over there in England. I ruther think I shall
go over there and try my luck one of these days, in his way, they
seem to be so taken up with us Yankees, but arter all if a feller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87] </a></span>has to go over England to let them lords and editors puff him,
afore anybody will take notice on him, he'd better take tu some
other bisness. There ain't a man in all this country that ever
wrote more genuine things than that chap did when he was a
leetle shaver in Yale College, and yet nobody would believe a
word on't till he went off to England. Now it's my opinion that
he never wrote anything arter he went off, half so much to his
credit as he did afore, and when he came here to York from about
our parts, jest as I've come now, if he didn't desarve tu be treated
well then, why he don't now, that's sartin. But I used to know
him down East, and it's my opinion that he's a first rate, hull-hearted
feller, and a rale ginuine poet tu boot! But I swanny!
Miss Miles, I must be a going, you hain't no idea how much I've
got to du!"</p>

<p>With that I got up and made a bow. She made a curchy,
and, sez she, "Mr. Slick, call agin, we shall always be glad to
see you."</p>

<p>"Sartinly," sez I; so I made another bow and cut stick down
stairs into the open street. But if Miss Miles ever ketches me
on her premises again, she'll ketch a weasel asleep. That Count
may marry her&mdash;what there is left of her&mdash;and go to grass, for
what I care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>It is eenamost twelve o'clock, jest arter New Years, and here
I be as wide awake as a night hawk, and a feeling purty considerably
rily in the upper story. So I believe it'll be about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88] </a></span>best thing I can du tu clap down and tell you all about New
Year's Day here in York.</p>

<p>But first I want tu tell you something about all the trials and
troubles that I've had tu go through since I wrote my last letter&mdash;I
don't believe there ever was a human critter so chased arter
as I've been. They talk about Cherry street not being fashionable,
but I'll be darned if I believe there's a more genteel street
in the city. It's the folks that live in a place that make it genteel
or not, and if Cherry street aint at the top of the mark
afore many more weeks, it'll be because I move my office out on
it, for there's no eend to the great shiny carriages that come
down and stop afore my door, eenamost every hour in the day.
It raly does look funny enough to see great pussey fellers, as big
as the side of the house, a sitting in them things all bolstered up
with cushions and kivered over with skins, like a baby shut up
in a go-cart afore it begins tu run alone.</p>

<p>T'other day there was one of these fat chaps come into my
office, and sot out tu make me believe that he was a sort of a
relation of mine. I didn't feel jest right, for since I begun to
print my letters in the Express it beats all natur how many relations,
that I never heard on afore, have been a trying tu scrape
an acquaintance with me. Wal, after a good deal of beating about
the bush, this chap at last made out purty tolerably clear that he
was a kind of a great toe cousin of our'n, and that he was born
and brought up in Weathersfield. He come his soft sodder over
me mighty smooth, and had a good deal to say about how much
he thought of us all, and how fond he'd been of Sam and me. I
wish you could a seen how he pussed out his mouth and breathed
through his nose, and what a heap of pomposity he put on when
he was a talking. He acted jest like our old turkey gobler, when
he goes training the young turkeys round the barnyard, with his
wings feathered out and his tail spread. Wal, arter talking all
kinds of rigmarole for about an hour, he begun to tell how hard
it was for a young man tu start in the world, and git along without
somebody tu give him a push up the hill, and that it didn't
make much odds how much genius a man had, or how smart he
was, if he hadn't some rich and influential friend tu back
him up.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89] </a></span></p>
<p>"Now," sez he, "cousin Slick," and you can't think how
easy he seemed tu call me cousin; "you've done purty well
since you come to York, considering that you hadn't nobody
to help you along but Mr. Beebe; but you must git a peg
higher yit; we must introduce you among the aristocracy."</p>

<p>"The what?" sez I.</p>

<p>"The aristocracy," sez he agin, strutting back, and poking
one hand down into his trousers' pocket, as if he was a going tu
take something out.</p>

<p>Wal, think sez I, I s'pose arter he's fumbled about long enough,
he'll show me what aristocracy is, if he carries it about in his
pocket like the rest on 'em; but he only took out a piece of
pinted gold, and begun to poke it between his teeth; and arter
he'd got through, he made out tu finish what he was a saying.</p>

<p>"Now," sez he, "I think I've seen Mr. Beebe at the New England
dinner, and at one or two places of that sort where one
meets almost every body, and for a merchant that hasn't made
enough to leave off business, I dare say he's a very respectable
sort of a man, but he don't exactly belong tu the&mdash;the; that is,
tu the class&mdash;who&mdash;which I mean tu take you inter, Mr. Slick;
a class that claim some standing from their ancestors&mdash;men of
family, that can be traced back like our's, cousin."</p>

<p>"Yes," sez I, sort o' pleased, "I believe we never had many
relations tu be ashamed on. Par always used to say that grandpa
Slick could make about the harnsomest pair of cow-hide boots
of any feller in Weathersfield; and as for uncle Josh, I'd be
darned if ever I saw his equal at shoeing a hos. They were
prime old chaps both on 'em&mdash;rale peelers, I can tell you. Now,
come tu think on it, there was one lazy coot of a feller that never
would work for a living; but he went off when I was a little
shaver, and our folks don't know what became of him. He
warn't much credit to us, that's a fact."</p>

<p>I don't know what on arth made my pussey cousin get so
fedgety all tu once, but he begun to hitch about in his chair, and
turned as red as a winter apple; and, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin Slick, this isn't the way we gentlemen prove that we
are men of family. If that was the way we did it, there aint
many men in the country that would go back two generations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90] </a></span>without breaking their neck over a lap stone or an anvil. Now
I have taken a good deal of pains to trace out our family line,
and the only way I could du it was to skip all the mechanics and
farmers, jest touch slightly on the merchants, lawyers and
ministers, but to dwell purty particularly hard on them that lived
high and did nothing; now a days it helps a feller along a good
deal if he can count up an author or so; and it was considered
something of a feather in a man's cap if any of his relations
were sent to Congress a few years ago; but now, since they've
got a kicking up a dust every other day in the Capitol, and to
spitting fire at each other like dogs and cats, it don't help a man
much to claim any of them for connexions except here and there
one that has got decency enough to be ashamed of the rest. I
begin to be glad that none of our family ever got into politics
much; but step to the door cousin Slick, and I'll show you the
coat-of-arms that I've got on my carriage."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I don't care if I du, though it comes kinder
tough to leave the stove this cold day." With that I tipped
down my chair, and took my feet off from the stove and went to
the door. By gracious! but he had a smasher of a coach standing
there. It glistened and shone in the sun like a house afire.
A great strapping nigger sot on a kind of double chair with a
low narrer back, kivered over with fine brown broadcloth, all
fringed and tossled off like any thing&mdash;and a great bear skin was
hauled up over his legs, all scolloped off with red cloth and stuck
over with coons' tails. The horses beat all live critters I ever
did see; they were as black as crows, and I couldn't say which
glistened the most, their tarnal smooth coots, or the harness put
over them. They were all kivered over and sot out with silver.
The horses had great yaller roses stuck on the sides of their
heads, like a gal when she's dressed up for a party. My pussey
cousin, he opened the door, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Look a here, cousin, haint this purty well got up?"</p>

<p>I looked inside, and there was a leetle sort of a room about
big enough for cousin Beebe to put his swarry in, if he wanted
to carry it about with him. It was all lined off and stuck full
of cushions, and tossled and fringed like a curtained bed. Two
great spotted skins lay tumbled up in the bottom, and there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91] </a></span>leetle glass doors with steps to them on both sides; it raly was
harnsome enough to make a feller's eyes feel snow-blind.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, a looking at my pussey cousin; "this does about
take the shine off eenamost all the coaches that ever stopped to
my office&mdash;and there's been a grist on 'em, I can tell you, and
some with tarnal handsome ladies in them too."</p>

<p>"Yes," sez he, sort of interrupting what I was going to say;
"but you haint a looking at the coat of arms&mdash;that is what I
want you to see."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, a giving the nigger a purty general survey, that
sot back of the horses dressed up in sort of regimentals, all finefied
off with buttons and yaller cloth; "The coat is well enough&mdash;I
don't see much to find fault with in it, though to own the
truth, Captin Wolf, of the Weathersfield Independent Company,
had a training coat that beats it all tu nothing. As for the critter's
arms, niggers may be different to white people in that way,
but I don't see much odds&mdash;mebby you mean this other chap's,
and his are long enough, that's a fact."</p>

<p>With that I jest took a good squint at a great tall shote of a
feller, with arms like a pair of flails hung up arter threshing.
He was a standing up back of the coach, and a hanging on to a
couple of great tossels fastened to it, as independent as a monkey
in a show. His coat and trousers were just like the nigger's, and
he had a great wide band of gold stuff round his hat! my pussey
cousin only shook his head when I looked at the chap. The
nigger twisted his neck round, and the tall varmint stuck his'n
up, and they begun to grin and tee hee at each other over the
coach.</p>

<p>"See here, this is what I mean," sez my cousin; and his fat
cheek begun to grow red with the cold or something. With that
he put his finger on a picter, all sprigged out with gold that
was figgered on the door, and sez he, "this is the coat and
arms."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I've seen a good many picters, but I never
heard them called by that name afore. I s'pose this is some York
notion that you've picked up, aint it?"</p>

<p>"It's the ginuine thing," sez he, "and I paid a deal of money
for it, I can tell you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92] </a></span></p>
<p>"Wal," sez I, a looking at the consarn purty sharp; "them
two critters a lying down there cut a considerable of a dash,
that's a fact; but the rooster on the top, that are beats all. It's
so nat'ral, it seems to me as if I could hear it cockadoodledoo
right out."</p>

<p>"Yes," sez my cousin, "that is well done, aint it? But I see
you don't exactly comprehend the science of heraldry. Now all
these things mean something."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" sez I.</p>

<p>"These are lions couchant," sez he, a pinting tu the wild
critters.</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" sez I agin; "I've seen a good many lions
in the shows that travel through Weathersfield, but I never saw
a croushong afore. They look purty much alike, don't they
though?"</p>

<p>With that the two varmints stuck up at each eend of the
carriage begun tu tee hee agin, and my pussey cousin, sez he,
"Mr. Slick, supposing we go in."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "but if you'd jest as lives, I should kinder like
tu know what the rooster means afore we go."</p>

<p>"Can't you guess what part of the Slick family that belongs
to?" sez he, a strutting up and rubbing his hands together as
proud as could be.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I don't know, without it belongs to Aunt
Lydia&mdash;par's old maid of a sister; she sartinly did beat all natur
at raising chickens. You never heard of an egg turning out rotten,
or a duck gitting drowned, on her premises."</p>

<p>With that the two chaps giggled right out, and stuck their fists
into their darn'd great tatur-traps as if they felt a cold; and my
pussey cousin, sez he, "it's a gitting cold&mdash;less go in."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I don't care if we du; but I tell you what, if
them two chaps don't jest hush up their yop, I'll give them both
an allfired thrashing&mdash;I will, by gosh!"</p>

<p>I ruther guess the two mean critters hauled in their horns a
few at this; and arter I'd gin them both a purty savage look, we
went into the office agin.</p>

<p>"Now," sez my pussey cousin, jest as soon as we'd both sot
down agin, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93] </a></span>"Cousin Slick, I've found you out, and I mean to du
something for you&mdash;something harnsome, you may depend on't.
Jest you call up to my house next New Year's day, and git acquainted
with my folks, and arter that you needn't be consarned
about anything. I'm purty well known here in the city, and <em>my</em>
relation can hold up his head almost anywhere, I should think!
I was down tu the Astor House t'other day," sez he, a stopping
to git breath and stretching both his legs out straight, while he
stuck both hands in his pockets, mighty big, "and there was that
foreign Count and Miss Miles's brother running on about you,
and swearing that they'd skin you alive the first time they caught
you in Broadway; but I went up tu them, and sez I, 'that young
gentleman is a near relation of mine, and anything you say agin
him, I take tu myself.' You can't think, cousin Jonathan, what
an impression it made! So you needn't have the least fear
of what they can du while I stand by you&mdash;they know me."</p>

<p>With that, my pussey cousin got up&mdash;and arter he'd shook
hands with me, he went off, carriage and all. I say, par, I wish
I could give you some idee of him. Did you ever see a great
spotted toad a swelling under a harrer, or a turkey gobbler jest
afore thanksgiving?</p>

<p>I say nothing; but didn't I larf arter he'd gone. The great
stuck-up bear, with his family, and his hens and roosters&mdash;he go
to grass.</p>

<p>Wal, jest as soon as my pussey cousin had cleared out, I put on
my hat, and streaked it down to Peck slip, for Captin Doolittle
has jest put in agin with another load of garden sarce; and think
sez I, mebby he can tell me something about this chap, for he
knows eenamost everybody that ever lived anywhere about
Weathersfield.</p>

<p>The Captin had jest sot down to dinner, and was a digging
away like all natur, at a hunk of cold pork and a raw onion; a
mug of something hot stood on the locker afore him, and he
looked like live, I can tell you.</p>

<p>"Wal, Jonathan," sez he, a looking kinder skewing at my new
trousers, "Wont you set by and take a bite?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I shoudn't mind if I did, but to-morrow is
New Year's, and I've got tu go and see a hull heap of these York
gals, and I'm afeard my breath will smell of the onions."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94] </a></span></p>
<p>I wish you could a seen how Captin Doolittle stared, as he
stuck his face close up tu mine, giving his jack-knife a grip, he
struck the butt eend of it down on the locker, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Jonathan, they're a spiling you down here in York, they be,
by hokey! Go hum, I tell you, and marry Judy White&mdash;she
knows what's what, and I can tell you these York gals that turn
up their noses at the smell of onions, can't have decent bringing
up any how. They've sot you agin onions already, and it wont
be a great while afore you'll turn agin your own relations."</p>

<p>"Now," sez I, "Captain Doolittle, don't say that are, it makes
me feel bad, and I don't desarve it. A feller that will let money,
or a stuck up name, or the handsomest gal that ever trod shoe
leather set him agin his own father and mother, desarves tu be
kicked tu death by grasshoppers."</p>

<p>This seemed to sort of mollify the captin, but he stripped the
peel off another onion mighty wrothy, and arter a minit sez he.
"Wal, Jonathan, I'm glad to hear that you've got some of your
old notions left, but I always make a pint not to talk when I'm a
eating, so if you won't set by, why just keep a stiff jaw while I
stow away another slice of pork and this piece of onion, and then
I'm the man for you."</p>

<p>With that he went to cutting off a chunk of pork and a chunk
of onion to hand about, till it fairly made my eyes water to see
him crunch them down. Arter a while he wiped his jack-knife
on his cuff, shut it tew with a jerk, and put it in his trousers'
pocket; then he took a pull at the mug, and arter he'd got a long
nine purty well a going, he stretched out his legs, and sez he:</p>

<p>"Wal, Jonathan, what did you come for, if you didn't want
nothing to eat?"</p>

<p>With that I sot down and told him all about my pussey cousin.
I could see that the critter had heard on him afore by the way
he twisted his mouth around about the long nine; but when I
told him about the carriage and rooster and so on, he jest took
and gave the long nine a fling, clapped his thumb agin the side
of his nose, and winking one eye, make his fingers twinkle up and
down for as much as a minit without saying a word; arter a
while he asked the critter's name, and when I told him, he jumped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95] </a></span>up, cut a pigeon wing over the locker, and stopping right afore
me, winked t'other eye, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a here, Jonathan, didn't your par never tell you about
Jase Slick, the great lazy coon, that got married and went off
West, because he was so allfired lazy that he couldn't git a living
like other folks? Jest let me cool off a leetle, and I'll tell you all
about him."</p>

<p>With that the Captin brushed away the onion skins and we sot
down together on the locker, and sez he&mdash;"Mebby your par
never told you what an etarnal lazy shote Jase was, but he did
beat all natur for doing nothing but swop jack-knives and pitch
coppers. He was a tickler though at trapping mushrats and
shooting foxes, and he use to send the skins down here to York.
Now it aint common that you'll find a lazy shack of a feller very
tight about money, but Jase was as close as the bark of a tree;
he'd a skinned a musketoe any day for the hide and taller. I
don't believe the critter ever stood treat in his hull life; I don't,
by gracious.</p>

<p>"Wal, arter all, he warn't a bad hearted feller; but when he
see that all the gals turned up their noses at him, and didn't give
him invites to their quiltings and so on, he coaxed me to let him
work his passage down here to York. He used to send his skins
by me, and so I kinder felt for him, and kept track on him a good
while arter he got here. He did purty tolerably well at first,
considering who it was&mdash;he bought a hand-cart, and took people's
trunks and sich things up from the steamboats and sloops that
put into Peck slip; but there was too much work about that to
suit him; so he got somebody to lend him a little money and sot
up a rum shop close by the slip.</p>

<p>"Arter that," sez the Captin, a picking up his long nine and a
lighting it, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96] </a></span>"arter that I kinder lost track on him, but somebody
told me that he'd swopped off his stock and gone out West. Wal,
two years go by purty quick, you know, Jonathan&mdash;or if you
don't know, you will, when you git to be as old as I am&mdash;and I
couldn't but jest believe it was so long since I'd seen the critter,
when I met him smash in the face one day when I was a scooting
up Wall-street, to get specie for a five dollar bill. Gracious
me! how he was a strutting up the side-walk&mdash;didn't he cut a
swarth&mdash;with his shiney black coat and the bunch of golden seals
a hanging down from his watch fob! He didn't seem to know
me at fust, but I went right straight up to him and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Wal, Jase, how do you do?' I never&mdash;how he did look!
First he kinder held out his hand a leetle, and then he hauled it
back agin, and, sez he, 'how do you du, sir?' but he seemed to
be all in a twitter. I didn't seem to mind it, but I stuck my
hands in my pockets jest as you do, Jonathan, there in your picters&mdash;and
sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tough and hearty as ever. How does the world use you
about these times?'</p>

<p>"It was as much as I could du to keep from larfin right out,
to see the etarnal pussey critter skew his head round and look at
the stream of men that was a going up and down on each side of
the way, as if he was afraid that some on 'em would see us, the
mean sneaking coot! Arter a minit he sez, sez he, 'Captin, I'm
in a hurry now, but I s'pose you can be found in the old place.
Good morning.'</p>

<p>"With that he jest put both hands under his coat tail, and
tilting it up a leetle, went sailing along up the side-walk like a
prize hog jest afore killing time. I snorted right out all I could
du to help it. Then I bent down my knees a leetle, and stuck my
hands down hard in both pockets, and I ruther guess the whistle
I sent arter him made all the folks stare a few. It wasn't good
manners, but I sarved him right. Jonathan, I'd been a friend to
the critter when he wanted one bad enough, and any man on
arth that's ashamed of his acquaintances because he's got a peg
above them in the way of money is a coward and a mean
shote,&mdash;there's no two ways about that.</p>

<p>"Wal, arter seeing Jase in the street so stuck up, I jest inquired
a little about him, what he'd been a doing and so on; and
arter a while, I found out what made him so mighty obstroporous.
You see he'd found out it warn't so easy tu git a living in
York without doing some kind of work, so he absquatelated, as
they say down here&mdash;but I don't think that's a ginuine word&mdash;and
went off West.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97] </a></span></p>
<p>"There he mushquashed round in the woods till he got tired
of that kind of fun, and then he squat down on a section of wild
land, cogitating a way tu git a living without grubbing for it.
Arter a while he went round to all the places that had any people
to brag on, and put up to the taverns, and told every body he
met there about the spot where his land lay&mdash;what capital land
it was&mdash;what good water and allfired heavy timber. He sent
here tu York and got him a map all pictured out chuck full of
water privileges and all sorts of things, till he raly made the
people believe that he'd found the very spot where the millinium
was a going tu begin; a place where every holler tree was stuck
full of honey comb, where the wild cats went pouring about
like so many rabbits, and the hen hawks cum down as kind as
could be tu help the hens feed their little chickens.</p>

<p>"Wal, it warn't long afore his soft sodder begun to work
among the greenhorns like yeast in a kneading trough full of
dough. Jonathan, if you ever see a flock of sheep shut up in a
paster, you know something worth while about human natur.
The minit one takes it into his head to clear the stun wall for
another lot, the others all foller hilter skilter, as if the old Harry
had kicked them on eend. Your Cousin Jase knew a thing or two
about the natur of mankind&mdash;he got the first sheep to make a jump,
and, hurra! it warn't no time before his section was all cut up into
town lots, and grist mills whirling three stuns, wherever there
was a quart of water tu make them go; and there was no eend
to the corduroy roads and log bridges, and great kivered waggons,
chuck full of women and children and other housen stuff,
with baskets and brass kittles a hanging on behind, that travelled
over them eenamost from one year tu another. When
folks began tu wonder what on arth he'd du next, the critter got
his territory transmogrified into a State, and then he sot railroads
a twistyfying every which way all through his lands; and
that made things rise in value like a toad stool in a hot night.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98] </a></span></p>
<p>"By the living hokey, the critter wasn't content with this, but
he got another kink into his head that did beat all. One way or
t'other, I don't know how, he got all his land and railroads and
so on, worked up into pieces of paper that they call scrip; he
bundled them all into his great coat pocket and come down to
York again. And in less than no time he had the scrip all cut
up into these red-backed bills with picters on 'em, that they offer
here in York for money&mdash;then he sot up a bank on his own hook,
where he keeps a making money hand over fist. He has a good
chance, I tell you, for he owns all in the bank; so he's President,
Cashier, and everything else, all himself, and arter all his laziness,
he's worth an allfired grist of money considering how he
got it."</p>

<p>I swanny, I couldn't hardly keep still while Captin Doolittle
was a talking. I felt all over in a twitter, and my mouth would
keep a sort of open with thinking so eager of what he was a
saying. The minit he'd done I jumped up and hollered right out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hurra," sez I, "if that aint Yankee all over. I haint the
least doubt now but the critter is jest what he says he is&mdash;Slick
to the back bone. Do you s'pose there is any animal on arth
besides a full-blooded Connecticut Yankee that would have gone
that way to get rich&mdash;all soft sodder and no work? I tell you
what it is, captin, I'm raly proud tu own the critter. He's done
some good in his day and generation, if he is so stuck up; for it
aint in the natur of things for a feller to git rich himself without
making a good many others better off. To help himself a great
deal a chap <em>must</em> help others a little, that's my notion."</p>

<p>"Yes," sez the captin, "but it's an etarnal shame for these
chaps tu curl up their noses at honest men."</p>

<p>"Jest so," says I.</p>

<p>With that I put on my hat, and was jest a going to cut stick&mdash;but
Captin Doolittle, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a here, Jonathan, if I was you, I'd make this chap pay
over a little of his chink, or else I wouldn't ride about with him&mdash;I
wouldn't, by gracious! He's tickled tu death tu get hold of
a chap like you to brag on; for now that he's got rich, you haint
no idee how anxious he is to make people think he knows something
and always did. He talks about his aristocracy. The men
of genius and talons make the real aristocracy in this country,
and he's in hopes of getting among 'em by claiming relationship
with you because you write for the papers. Supposing you ask
him to lend you a couple of thousand dollars."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99] </a></span></p>
<p>"No," sez I, "I'll be darned if I du. If I can't cut my own
fodder I'll go hum agin."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez the Captin, "mebby you can git him tu help you
print your letters in a book. Your par would be tickled tu
death if you could print a book like that Sam writ."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, sort o' proud, "there needn't be no hurry about
that are; but if I du print one, and it can't pay its own expenses
and a leetle over, it may go tu grass!"</p>

<p>With that I bid Captin Doolittle good-bye, and made tracks
for my office agin.</p>

<p class="chaphead">New-Year's Calls&mdash;A real Yankee's New-Year's Treat of Dough-nuts
and Cider&mdash;Jonathan's ideas of the real difference between a real
lady's House and Furniture and the House of a stuck-up Parvenu&mdash;Jonathan's
ideas of Love and Ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>I made a leetle inquiry about how people did a New Year's
Day, and found out that it was the fashion for the wimmen tu
stand treat that day, to set out things, and invite everybody that
come tu take a bite. So arly in the morning I put a clean white
towel on the leetle table in my office. Then I went into the
cubby house room, where I keep my new clothes and kindling
wood, besides my tooth brush and sich things as I don't want to
use every day, and I drew a quart mug of that outrageous good
cider, that you sent me by Captin Doolittle. I guess I looked
like live when I went out agin, with the mug brimming over in
one hand, and the pillow-case stuffed full of dough-nuts, that
marm sent me t'other day&mdash;besides the hunk of cheese, and the
lot of baked sweet apples, tucked under t'other arm. I heaped
up a pile of the dough-nuts on one corner of the table, and sot
the apple-box on the other, an made room for the cheese and the
cider in the middle; and it raly made me feel sort of bad because
marm couldn't see how nice I'd fixed it all. Think sez I, there
wont be many people in York that'll set a better treat afore their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100] </a></span>visiters than this I reckon, any how, and as marm aint here I'll
stand treat to every body that comes in for her sake.</p>

<p>Wal, who should be the fust critter that come in but cousin
John Beebe, tu see what I was a going tu du with myself all day.
Arter I'd sot him a chair by the stove, I went up to the table,
and sez I,</p>

<p>"Cousin John supposing we take a drink; it's an allfired cold
day, and you look as if you couldn't stand it." My gracious, but
didn't his eyes snap when he saw what I'd got. I mixed the
cider up, purty hot with ginger, and then I sot it on the stove,
and kept a stirring on it up with a little ivory thing that a purty
gal sent me tu fold my letters with; it begun to foam and sparkle
like anything; then I took a sip jest to try it, and handed the
mug over to cousin John.</p>

<p>"Here," sez I, "take a swaller; it aint like the pesky stuff
you give me when I eat dinner up to your house. Instid of
kicking up a dust in your upper story, it goes tu the right spot
tu once, and makes a feller feel prime all over in a giffy." I
ruther seem to think that cousin John warn't much afeard of the
mug anyhow; he gave a sneezer of a pull tu it, and then his
eyes begun to glisten, and, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm beat, Jonathan, if this aint prime; where on arth did
you find it? I've sarched from one eend of York tu t'other for
it a dozen times, but never made out tu get a drop yit." With
that he sot into it agin like all natur. "I declare," sez he, agin,
choaking off long enough tu ketch his breath, "this does taste
nat'ral."</p>

<p>"Aint it the rale critter?" sez I, a bending for'ard and rubbing
both hands together a leetle easy. "It eenamost make me humsick
when I first tasted on it, it put me so in mind of Weathersfield.
Par sent me a whole cag on it, by Capt. Doolittle."</p>

<p>"Then it <em>did</em> come from the old humstid?" sez he, a eying the
mug agin&mdash;"I must drink a leetle more, for the sake of them
that sent it." With that, he jest finished up the mug; and when
he sot it down, he drew a long breath, and sez he agin, "that's
prime, Jonathan."</p>

<p>"Aint it," sez I, starting off tu fill up the mug agin, for it
tickled me tu see how he took tu the drink, and how much he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101] </a></span>made himself tu hum in my office. When I cum out of the
leetle room agin, John he looked sort of eager at the mug and
then at the eatables laid out so tempting.</p>

<p>"I declare," sez he, "I begin tu feel as I use tu when we were
boys, Jonathan." With that I sot the table between us, and the
way we laid into the provinder was a compliment to marm.
Arter cousin Beebe had eat ten of the doughnuts, and a hunk
of cheese as big as your fist, he stopt short, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin, this wont du; if we keep on eating as much as we
want, we shan't find room for all the eatables and drinkables that
the folks will give us to-day, when we make our calls."</p>

<p>"Look a here, cousin Beebe," sez I, kinder anxious, "you know
I'm a sort of a greenhorn about New Year's, for we don't have
no sich things over amongst us. Supposing you jest tell me how
they act and so on. I don't want tu make a coot of myself;
and that pussey cousin of mine is a coming tu take me round in
his carriage, where I suppose he means tu stick me up like a
swarry for folks tu look at; and if I don't du everything according
to gunter, he'll be turning red and fussing about like an old
hen that's got ducks for chickens. What on arth shall I say to
the gals, and what will they expect me to du?"</p>

<p>Cousin Beebe he sot still a minit, kinder nibbling away at the
end of a dough-nut, for he seemed mortal loth to choke off, and
at last sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you come tu a house where you want tu call, jest go
into the room where the ladies will be a waiting tu see folks,
and arter a while they'll ask you to take some refreshments:
with that they'll go up tu a table where there's wine and so on,
if they hain't teetotalists, and if they be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It don't make no odds tu tell me how <em>they</em> act," sez I, "for
I don't call on anybody that sets up to be wiser than our Savior;
he turned water into wine, and when I set up tu be better than
him, I'll turn up my nose at it, but not afore. I wish you could
a heard par argufy that question with the ministers. I rather
guess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here cousin Beebe sot in, and sez he, "Well, jest fill up a
glass for the lady about half full, not a drop more, then pour out
a glass for yourself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102] </a></span></p>
<p>"What, full?" sez I.</p>

<p>"Sartinly," sez he.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I; "that seems kinder hoggish tu give yourself
more than you du to the lady; I don't seem tu like that."</p>

<p>"It's the fashion," sez he.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it?" sez I; "wal I think as like as not they know how
to help themselves arter a feller's gone. I always notice that the
gals that are so mighty stuck up as if they couldn't swaller anything
but air before folks, stuff like all natur back of the pantry
door."</p>

<p>John larfed a leetle as if he agreed with me, and sez he,
"Never mind that now, but when you've poured out the wine,
jest step back and make a bow, and say, 'The compliments of
the season,' or any other interesting thing that you like. A
person of your genius should not be at a loss for pleasant sayings&mdash;and
after that drink off the wine, take a leetle of anything
else that is on the table, and go away agin."</p>

<p>"Wal now," sez I, "I can remember what to say well
enough, though it does seem to me that there would be a leetle
too much soft sodder in the speech, if it warn't made to a lady;
but suppose you jest go over the man&oelig;uvre about the wine, so
that I can git the kink on it, if you hain't no objection."</p>

<p>"Very well," sez he, "remember I'm you, and you are the
lady."</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, a taking up the cider mug, "observe me."
With that he made a purlite bow, and give another allfired pull
at the drink. I see what the critter was at; but think sez I, I
ruther think you've had your share of the cider. With that, I
put out both hands a leetle easy, and took the mug from his
mouth.</p>

<p>"See if I hain't larnt it," sez I, as sober as a deacon; and with
that I made him a low bow, and while I was a drinking off the
cider, I jest winked one eye over the top of the mug, tu let him
see that I was up tu a thing or two. The minit I pulled up, he
began tu laugh as good-natured as a kitten; and arter I'd got
my breath, I sot in, and we had a good haw-haw right out in the
office.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103] </a></span></p>
<p>Arter we'd both got sobered down, John he gave me an invite
to come up and see Mary, and then he cut stick tu go home and
fix for visiting. I hadn't but jest time to run out and git a piece
of Injun rubber to clean my yaller gloves with, and begin tu fix
up, when my pussey cousin come up the street, hurra boys, carriage
and all, arter me. The tall chap let himself down from
behind the carriage, and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," sez I, a poking round the office arter a pin tu stick
my shirt-color together, where the etarnal washerwoman had
washed the button off, consarn her!</p>

<p>The feller was dressed up like a Connecticut Major-General,
all in yaller and blue, as fine as a fiddle; he kinder grinned a
little when he see my table, and that I hadn't got my fix on yet;
but when I looked in his face, he choked in, and, sez he, as humble
as could be&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, my master is a waiting."</p>

<p>"Tell him not tu be in a pucker," sez I, "I ain't quite spruced
up yet." With that he went out&mdash;I pitched on my clothes in
less than no time, stuffed a baked apple and a few dough-nuts
into my coat pocket, for fear of accident, and follered arter.
There he stood a holding open the glass door, and a set of little
steps, all carpeted off, hung down tu the ground; and there was
the fat nigger a twistifying his whip-lash round the horses'
heads, as crank as a white man. I jest had time tu see that Jase
had got his lions and roosters and crouchants pictered off on the
curtain that hung round his seat; and then I jumped into the
carriage as spry as a cricket. The tall chap folded up the steps
as quick as marm could undu a cat's cradle, and shet the door
tu, and away we went like a house a-fire. I swanny! but these
coaches du go over the ground as slick as grease; it seemed jest
like being bolstered up in a rocking-chair! My pussey cousin
seemed tu swell up bigger and bigger every minit, when he see
how surprised I was with the spring of it; and, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, cousin, I'm going tu take you tu see somebody worth
knowing, and when they know that you're my relation, they'll
take a good deal of notice of you; so jest put your best foot foremost."</p>

<p>Think sez I, it's looky that I got cousin Beebe tu show me how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104] </a></span>it's done; but I kept a close lip and said nothing, for it was snapping
cold, and a feller's words seemed as if they'd turn tu ice,
before he spoke 'em.</p>

<p>The nigger driv like fire and smoke, and it didn't seem no
time afore we stopped by a great house clear up town, and the
tall shote opened the door and undid the steps again, as if he
expected us tu git out.</p>

<p>"This is my house," sez my pussey cousin, "you go in and
call on the ladies, and I'll dive round to one or two houses, and
take you with me again, by and by."</p>

<p>I got up sort of loth, for it seemed kinder awk'ard to go in
alone; but afore I had a chance to say so, the tall shote shet tu
the stairs, gin the door a slam, hopped up behind agin, and away
they went like a streak of lightning.</p>

<p>I stood a minit, a looking about. It was cold enough to nip a
feller's ears off, so I jest tucked my hands into my pockets as
well as I could, and begun tu stomp my foot on the stun walk.
It raly was fun to see the streets chuck full of fellers running up
and down, hither and yon, as if the old Nick had kicked them
on eend. Every one on 'em was dressed up in his Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes, and they all had their hair slicked down exactly
alike, and most on 'em looked more like gals in boys' clothes than
anything else. Not the shadow of a petticoat could a feller see,
from one eend of York tu the other&mdash;it seemed as if the hull city
had run tu boys for one day. The streets raly looked lonesome;
for, arter all, it don't seem nat'ral to go out and not see gals and
women a walking about with their purty faces and fine clothes.
A city without them, looks like a piece of thick woods without
any sweet, green under-brush and harnsome flowers. I don't
know exactly why, but when I go into a place where there's
nothing but men, it seems as if all the sunshine and posies of
human natur was shet out; and as I stood there afore my pussey
cousin's house, it made me feel sort of melancholy not to see the
least glimpse of a red shawl or a furbelow nowhere about.</p>

<p>I believe arter all, that when a chap is a leetle scared about
doing a thing, the best way is tu pitch for'ard, hit or miss,
without thinking on it. So as soon as I'd got a leetle grit raised,
I up and pulled the door knob as savage as could be. It was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105] </a></span>allfired big chunk of silver though, and the piece spread out on
the door was as big as a dinner-plate, and there was "<span class="smcap">Jason
Slick</span>" cut out on it in all sorts of flourishes and curlecues.
Think sez I, my pussey cousin means to hang out a specie sign,
anyhow. I wonder he didn't have his rooster and lion and
crouchants pictered off in his door too.</p>

<p>Arter a minit a tall chap that looked like a twin tu the feller
that stood behind the carriage, all dressed out jest as he was,
too, like a major-gineral, stood a bowing and shuffling in the
hall, as if he wanted to larn me how to dance. The way he
sidled and bowed and spread out his hands as he opened the
parlor door for me, was enough to make a feller bust with larfin.
Wal, afore I knew which eend my head was on, there I stood in
the middle of a great long room, that was enough to dazzle a
feller's eyes for a month, eenajest to look at it. The settees were
all bright red, and glistened with thick velvet cushions. Great,
heavy, yaller curtains hitched up with spears and poles, made
out of gold, or something plaguey like it, hung over all the winders&mdash;all
furbelowed and tossled off with great, blue balls, mixed
up with red fringe. The carpet was the brightest and softest
thing I ever did see&mdash;but it was enough tu make a feller stun
blind tu look at it, the figgers on it were so allfired gaudy.
Everything in the room was as costly and harnsome as could be;
but somehow it seemed as if every individual thing had come
there on its own hook, and was so proud of itself that it
wouldn't agree with its neighbors. The chairs looked dreadfully
out of sorts with the settees, and the great looking-glasses
made everything seem ten times more fiery and bright with
their glistening. The hull room seemed more like a garden
planted with poppies, sun-flowers, and marygolds, than anything
I could think on. There was a table sot out at one eend, jest
afore one of the looking-glasses, that made it seem as long agin
as it raly was. It was all kivered over with silver baskets and
knives and forks, and glasses, and everything that could be
thought on tu eat and drink. At both eends were leetle meeting-houses
with steeples tu them, all made out of sugar-candy,
and hull loaves of cake with flowers and birds a lying down on
top of 'em; besides some had leetle sugar lambs curled up on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106] </a></span>'em, as nat'ral as life. I never did see a table so set off in my
born days; it was a sight to look on. Cousin Beebe's warn't a
touch tu it; but somehow the things were all crowded on so,
and there was sich heaps of everything, that it didn't seem half
so genteel as Cousin Mary's did. It must have cost an allfired
swad of money, though.</p>

<p>I was so struck up with the room and the table, that it was
more than a minit afore I found out that there were any folks in
the premises; but by-am-by I discovered a fat chunked woman
a sitting in a rocking chair all cushioned with red shiney velvet.
She sot close by the fire, but when I stepped back and put my
foot out to make a bow, she got up and made me a curchy&mdash;but
sich a curchy I never did see&mdash;it was about half-way
between the flutter of a hen and the swagger of a fat duck. It
was as much as I could du to keep from snorting right out to
see her; but I choked in, and sez I, bowing again, "You see I
make myself tu hum, marm. Mr. Slick, my pussey cousin, out
there, wanted me to come and make you a New Year's call."</p>

<p>I wish you could a seen how the critter strutted up when I
said this; but all tu once she seemed to guess who I was, for she
stuck her head a one side, and begun to smile and pucker up
her mouth like all natur. Up she cum tu me with both hands
out, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin, I'm delighted to see you. Mr. Slick was telling me
about you yesterday, and sez I, invite him by all means. It
ain't often we can make free with a relation, they are so apt to
presume upon it. Raly, some of Mr. Slick's family have been
very annoying, they have indeed; they don't seem to understand
our position; but you, cousin, you that have so much mind,
can comprehend these things."</p>

<p>Afore I could get a chance to stick in a word edgeways, she
took my hand, yaller glove and all, between both her'n, and led
me along to the fire. Arter I'd sot down, she kept a fingering
over one of my hands as if it belonged to her. Think sez I,
what on arth can the old critter mean? I'll be darned, if she
was fifteen years younger, I should think she had such a notion
to the family, that she wasn't particular how many on 'em she
made love tu. As soon as I could git her to give up my hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107] </a></span>she jest let her'n drop on my knee as affectionate as a pussy cat,
and sez she, a screwing up her mouth, and sticking her face close
up to mine&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin, you can't think how delighted I was to read your
letters in the <i>Express</i>. I du like to see such upstarts as the
Beebe's taken off; only think of the idee of her giving parties,
and her husband not out of business yit! When I read that letter,
sez I to Mr. Slick, 'bring the young gentleman here, where
he can see something of <em>real</em> high life; it would be a pity to
have him throw away his talons in describing such low affairs as
Mrs. Beebe's must be.'" With that she looked round her blazing
room as proud as could be, as if she wanted me to give her
some soft sodder back agin; but I felt sort of wrathy at what
she said about cousin, and I wouldn't take the hint; but sez I,
"I beg pardon, marm, but Mr. Beebe is my friend and relation,
and a chap that'll set still and hear a friend run down, don't
deserve one, according to my notion; as for cousin Mary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," sez Mrs. Slick, a twisting round like an eel, "she is a
lovely woman, without any doubt. I sartinly should have called
on her long ago; but then one has so many acquaintances of that
sort to remember, that really I have never found time." Think
sez I, if you wont call till Mary wants you, I don't think you'll
put yourself out in a hurry; but I didn't say so, for jest that
minit she seemed to remember something, and she sung out,
"Jemima, my dear."</p>

<p>With that the yaller curtains by one of the winders were
rustled and flirted out, and a young gal, finefied off to kill, come
from where she'd been standing back on 'em to look at the fellers
as they went along the street. I ruther guess there was a flirting
of ribbon and a glistening of gold things when she made her appearance.
She came a hopping and a dancing across the room,
and when she come jest afore me, she stopped short and let off a
curchy that seemed more like one of her mother's run crazy, than
any thing I could think on. The old woman she spread out her
hands, and sez she, "Jemima, my dear, this is your cousin, Mr.
Slick, the gentleman whose letters you were so delighted with."</p>

<p>With that the queer critter gave me another curchy and
looked as if she'd a been glad if she'd known enough to say something;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108] </a></span>but the old woman sot in with a stream of talk about her
till any body on arth would have sot her down for an angel jest
out of heaven, dressed up in pink satin and loaded off with gold,
if they'd believed a word her mother said. Think sez I to myself,
as I stood a looking at the old woman and the gal, it's enough to
make a feller sick of life to see two such stuck up critters. The
gal's furbelows didn't look so bad considering she was so young,
yet it always seems to me as if heaps of jimcracks and finery
piled on to a young critter looked kinder unnat'ral. Wimmen
are a good deal like flowers to my notion, and the harnsomest
posies that grow in the woods never have but one color besides
their leaves. I've seen gals in the country with nothing but pink
sun bonnets and calico frocks on, that looked as fresh and sweet
as full blown roses&mdash;gals that could pull an even yoke with any
of your York tippies in the way of beauty, and arter all if I ever
get a wife I don't think I shall sarch for her among brick houses
and stun side-walks.</p>

<p>The old woman raly had made an etarnal coot of herself in the
way of fixing. She had on a lot of satin, and shiny thin stuff
twistified round her head kinder like a hornet's nest; in front on
it, jest over the leetle curls all rolled and frizzled round her face,
a bird&mdash;a rale ginuine bird, all feathered off as bright as a rainbow&mdash;was
stuck with its bill down and its tail flourished up in
the air, as if it had jest lit to search for a place to build a nest in.
I never see one of the kind afore, for its tail looked like a handful
of corn-silk, it was so yaller and bright; but, think sez I, it
must be some sort of a new-fashioned woodpecker, for it's the
natur of them birds always to light on any thing holler&mdash;and if
he was once to get a going on that old woman's head, I've an
idee there'd be a drumming. She had a leetle short neck, all
hung round with chains, and capes, and lots of things&mdash;besides, a
leetle watch, all sot over with shiny stuns, was hung to her side,
and her fat chunked fingers was kivered over with rings, that
looked like the spots on a toad's back more than any thing else.
She had a great wide ruffle round the bottom of her frock, like
the one cousin Mary had on at her party; but she warn't no
where nigh so tall as Mary, and it made her look like a bantum
hen feathered down to the claws. Wal, think sez I, if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109] </a></span>wouldn't make a comical figger-head fur Captin Doolittle's sloop.
I wonder what your husband would ask for you, jest as you stand&mdash;hump,
ruffles and all? I shouldn't a taken so much notice of
her, if she hadn't let off such a shower of talk on me about her
darter; but when a woman begins to pester me by praising up
her family, I always make a pint of thinking of something else as
fast as I can. If you only bow a leetle, and throw in a "yes
marm, sartingly," and so on, once in a while, you're all right. A
woman will generally soft-sodder herself, if you let her alone
when she once gits a going, without putting you to the trouble
of doing it for her.</p>

<p>Arter she'd talked herself out of breath, she went along up to
the table, and spreading her hands, sez she, "Take some refreshments,
Mr. Slick?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I haint much hungry, but I do feel a leetle dry&mdash;so
I don't care if I du."</p>

<p>I went up to the table, and took a survey of the decanters and
cider-bottles; and arter a while, I made out to find one decanter
that looked as if it had something good in it, and poured about a
thimble full into two of the wine glasses, and filled up one for
myself. Mrs. Slick and her darter took up the glasses, and then
I stepped back and made a low bow, and sez I, "The compliments
of the season!&mdash;or any other interesting thing that you like. A
person of your genius&mdash;&mdash;" Here I stuck fast, for somehow I
forgot how cousin Beebe told me to top off in the speech. But
the old woman puckered up her mouth, and curchyed away as if
I'd said it all out; and the gal, she went over the same man&oelig;uvre,
and laughed so silly, and put back her long curls with her
white gloves&mdash;for she had gloves on though she was tu hum&mdash;and
sez she, "<em>Oh</em>, Mr. Slick," and then her marm chimed in, and sez
she, "Now that you've mentioned genius, Mr. Slick, I do think
my Jemima has a talent for poetry."</p>

<p>Think sez I, it raly is surprising how much genius there is
buried up in these York brick houses. I hain't been to see a
family since I've been down here that hadn't some darter that
<em>could</em> write so beautiful, only she was so proud and diffident and
modest, that she could not be coaxed to have any thing printed.
Think sez I, if that leetle stuck up varmint has took to poetry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110] </a></span>there'll be a blaze in the newspaper world afore long. She's sartin
to set the North River on fire, if nobody else ever did.</p>

<p>I remembered what cousin Beebe told me about helping
myself to eatables, so I sot down by the table and hauled a plate
up to me, and begun to make myself to hum. There was no
eend to the sweet things that I piled up on my plate and begun
to store away with a silver knife and a spoon. Mrs. Slick, she
begun to fuss about, and offered to help me to this, that and
t'other, till I should raly have thought she didn't care how much
I eat, if she hadn't contrived to tell me how much every thing
cost all the time. Jest as I was finishing off a plate of foreign
presarves, the door-bell rung, and in streaked five or six fellers,
dressed up tu kill. It raly made me eenamost snicker out to see
how slick and smooth every one of 'em had combed his hair
down each side of his face. They all looked as much alike as if
they'd been kidney beans shelled out of the same pod. When
the old woman and the gal sot to wriggling their shoulders and
making curchies to them, I begun to think it was time for me to get
up and give them a chance. So I bolted the last spoonful of
presarves, and took out my red silk hankercher to wipe my
mouth. I thought it come out of my pockets purty hard,
so I gave it a twitch, and hurra! out come three of the
doughnuts that I'd tucked away to be ready in case of fodder's
getting scarce, and they went helter-skelter every which way all
over the carpet. At fust I felt sort of streaked, for the young
chaps begun to giggle, and Miss Jemima Slick she bust right out.
I looked at her, and then I looked at the fellers, and then, instead
of sneaking off, I bust right out, jest as if I didn't know how they
come there, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Did you ever!"</p>

to wipe my mouth. I thought it come out of my pocket purty hard, so I
gave it a twitch, and hurra! out come three of the dough-nuts&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't say another word, but jest made them a low bow all
round, and was a going out, but Mrs. Slick got hold of my arm,
and told me not tu seem to mind the doughnuts, and said, sort of
low, that she'd tell the gentlemen that I was a relation of her'n,
and that there warn't no danger of their poking fun at me about
it. Think sez I, I see how to get out of the scrape: she'll think
I'm awful mean not to offer her some of the doughnuts, when I
had them in my pocket, so seeing it's new-year's day, I'll make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111] </a></span>her think I brought 'em tu make her a present on, for relation's
sake. I jest went back, and picked up the tarnal things, and
heaping them up in one hand, I made a smasher of a bow as I
held 'em out tu her, and, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought mebby you'd like tu see how a prime Weathersfield
doughnut would taste agin; so I jest tucked a few one
side, tu bring up here; take 'em, you're as welcome as can be;
I've got enough more tu hum."</p>

<p>She looked at the gentlemen, and then she turned red, as if
she didn't exactly know how tu take me.</p>

<p>"Don't be afeard on 'em," sez I, "they're fust rate; chuck full
of lasses, and fried in hog's lard as white as snow."</p>

<p>With that she took them out of my hand and put them on the
table, and, sez she, a puckering up her mouth, "you men of
genius are so droll."</p>

<p>Think sez I, I've made a good hit off this time, any how, so
I'll cut stick. I made another bow, and out I went, jest as the
chaps were all a bowing and saying, "the compliments of the
season," one arter another, like boys, in a spelling class.</p>

<p>I hadn't but jest got to the door, when my pussey cousin driv
up, so I got intu the carriage, and off we went, down Broadway,
at a smashing rate, till at last we stopped afore one of the neatest-looking
houses that I've seen in York: it warn't crinckled
and finefied off with wood-work and iron fences, but the hull was
solid stun. The steps were made of the same, with great stun
sides a rolling down from the door tu the side-walk. The door
was sunk clear intu the front; there warn't no chunk of silver
in the middle, tu write the owner's name on; so I s'pose he
thought that every body ought to know where a rale fashionable
chap lives, without his hanging out a sign to tell folks.
Jason was jest a going tu give the knob a twitch, but he seemed
to remember, and, sez he, to the tall chap that had got down,</p>

<p>"Why don't you ring?"</p>

<p>With that the chap made a dive up the steps, and it warn't a
second afore the door swung open, and a nice old feller, dressed
up as neat as a new pin, but without regimentals, stood inside.
Arter making a bow, he opened a mahogany door, and made a
little motion with his hand, as much as to say&mdash;"walk in."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112] </a></span></p>
<p>Jason he kinder seemed loth to go in fust; and arter all his
money, I couldn't help but think the old feller in the hall looked
as well and acted a good deal more like a rale gentleman, than
he did. There's nothing like being rich to git up a man's
pluck; arter fidgeting with his watch-seals a minit, Jase stuck
up his head like a mud turtle in the sun, and in he went. I
follered arter as close as a bur tu a chestnut; for in my hull life
I never felt so scared.</p>

<p>The house didn't seem like Miss Miles's nor Cousin Beebe's, nor
yet like my pussey cousin's. Coming from his house into that,
seemed like going out of a blustering wind into a calm snowstorm.
Every thing was so slick and still, that it didn't seem
like anything else that I ever see. Cousin Slick went in fussing
along, and a tall harnsome lady got up from a chair, where she
sot by the fire, and cum towards us. Arter Jason had give her
a little information about the weather&mdash;told her it was dreadful
cold, and so on, he stepped back, and spreading out his hands
sort of like his wife, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, this is Mr. Jonathan Slick, a young relation of
mine."</p>

<p>I declare it made my heart beat to see how purtily she smiled&mdash;her
curchy was as soft and easy as a bird&mdash;she didn't wriggle
up her shoulders and stick out her feet as some of the rest of 'em
did, but jest seemed to droop down a little easy, and then she
asked us to sit down; and in less than no time we felt as much
tu hum as if we'd known her ever since she was a nursing baby.
Instead of beginning to give me a lot of soft sodder, as some of
the other women did, she jest set in and began to talk about old
Connecticut, and sich things as she must a seen was likely to
tickle me like all natur, and her voice was so soft, and she kept a
smiling so, that I never felt so contented in my life as I did a
talking with her.</p>

<p>At last she began to ask Jason some questions about the Western
country&mdash;so I had a chance to look about me a leetle. Instead
of being dressed out like a thing sot up for a show, she
hadn't nothing on but a harnsome silk frock, and a leetle narrow
velvet ribbon tied round her harnsome black hair, that was
brushed till it looked as bright as a crow's back. I never did see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113] </a></span>anything braided up so nice as it was behind. She hadn't on the
leastist bit of gold nor furbelows of any kind, only jest a leetle
pin that glistened like a spark of fire, which pinned the velvet
ribbon jest over her white forehead. It raly beats me to make
out why I can't tell you what was in the room, jest as I du about
all the other places; but somehow it aint easy to tell the difference,
for there was settees, and chairs, and tables, and curtains,
and so on&mdash;but yet it warn't a bit like any room I ever see
afore. There warn't no glistening and shining, and gold and
silver; but I couldn't get the notion out of my head that everything
cost a good deal more than if there had been ever so much of
it. The room seemed made exactly for the things that were in
it, and there warn't a thing that didn't fit exactly into its place
like wax-work. There was one consarn that looked awful harnsome,
and it was rale ginuine too; but at first I thought it was
some of these York make-believes. It was a slim green tree,
eenamost tall enough to reach my head, all blown out and kivered
over with as much as twenty of the biggest and whitest
roses I ever did see. It was sot jest below the two winders, and
when the sun came kinder softly through the curtains down into
the white posies they seemed to sort o' blush like a beach blow;
yit they raly were as white, according to natur, as the cleanest
handful of snow you ever see. The tree grew out of a great
marble flower-pot, and when I asked its name of the lady, she
looked as bright and sweet as one of the flowers, and told me it
come from Japan, away east. There was some picters hung agin
the wall, that struck my eye so that I couldn't keep from looking
at 'em. She see how I was took up, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's a beautiful picter, Mr. Slick, don't you think so?
There is something in Doughtie's picters that I love to look on;
his grass and hillocks are so soft and green, he does excel every
American artist most certainly in his atmosphere."</p>

<p>"Wal, marm," sez I, "I aint no judge of picters, but sartinly,
to my notion that does outshine cousin Jason's lions and
roosters, and croushongs, all to nothing. It don't glisten so
much, but somehow them great trees du look so nat'ral, and
them cows lying down under them so lazy; it eenamost makes
me hum sick to go back to Weathersfield when I see it." Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114] </a></span>Jase trod on my toe with his consarned hard boot. Wal, think
sez I, what have I said now; and I looked right in the lady's
face to see if she'd been a laughing; but she looked so sweet and
unconsarned as could be, and sez she, a getting up and going
across the room; for Jase made a motion as if he was in a hurry,
sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me help you to some cake and wine."</p>

<p>With that she went to a table that had some decanters and
wine-glasses on it, besides a loaf of cake as white as drifted
snow. I sniggers, but it did look as neat as a new pin. There
was a heap of rale flowers and leaves, jest picked from the bush,
fresh and fair, twisted round the edge of the cake, and a leetle
white sugar dove snuggled down in the middle.</p>

<p>Cousin Jase filled the glasses and he made a leetle speech&mdash;but
somehow it didn't seem to me as if I could go to talking soft
sodder tu that harnsome critter&mdash;she looked so sweet yet so
proud. All I did was jest to drink the wine, and then bend my
head kinder softly to try and match her curchy&mdash;but if I didn't
wish her a happy New Year in my heart, I'm a lying coot, that's
all. When we went away, she gave us an invite to come
agin, and she was mortal perlite to me. If I don't go, it'll be because
I'm afeard, for I don't know when I've taken such a shine
to anything that wears petticoats.</p>

<p>Jest as soon as I'd got clear of the door, and Jase had bowed
and scraped himself out, we got into the carriage agin, and sez
he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wal, cousin, how do you like Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Like her!" sez I, "if I don't there's no snakes. She's none
of your stuck up, finefied, humbug critters, but a <em>rale ginuine
lady</em>, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"It's a pity she hasn't more taste and emulation to fix up her
house," sez he. "She raly don't know how to cut a dash, and
yet her husband is as rich as a Jew."</p>

<p>"Wal, raly, I don't know what to think of that," sez I.
"Somehow when I see everything in a room kinder shaded off,
one color into another that's eenamost like it, till the hull seemed
to be alike, jest as it is in that lady's room,&mdash;it seems to take my
notion amazingly. I can't tell you why, but it made me feel as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115] </a></span>if the room had been made up into a big picter, and so it is in
part, and I begin to think that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was a going to say something allfired cutting about these
stuck up flashy houses and people that I'd seen here in York&mdash;when
the carriage driv up to another door. In we went, eat and
drank, and then out agin; and then it was riding from one house
to another, and eating and drinking till it got eenajest dark,
and I was clear tuckered out, besides beginning tu feel wamblecropped
a leetle, with the heap of sweet things I'd been eating
all day.</p>

<p>This New Year's day here in York is sartainly as good as a
show,&mdash;such lots of gals as a feller sees, and such lots of good
living; but give me a Thanksgiving dinner yit afore a York New
Year's,&mdash;a good turkey with plenty of gravy and tatur. I
swanny, how I wish I'd been a eatin them things instead of this
heap of tarnal cake and sugar things. I shan't feel right agin in
a month, I'm sure on it.</p>

<p>I guess you Weathersfield tee totalists would a stared some tu
see how the young chaps begun tu make fence along the stun
side-walks towards night; some on 'em were purty well over the
bay I can tell you. I went to see lots of women and gals, and
cousin Mary amongst the rest, and arter I got back to my office
I couldn't get one wink of sleep. My head was chuck full of
gals all night,&mdash;such a whirring and burring as there was in my
upper story you never did know on,&mdash;every time I shet my
eyes the office seemed chuck full of purty gals and feathers
and gold and decanters, cut glass, till it seemed as if I would go
crazy a thinking over all I'd done; but the last thing that got
into my brain jest afore I dropped to sleep, was the <em>real lady</em>
and my pussey cousin's stuck up wife.</p>

<p>But I can't stop to write you on all my dreams that night. I
don't think doughnuts or sugar candies set well on the stomach,
and I don't think seeing so many gals sets well on my head.
There is a terrible all over-ish sort of a feeling in a young feller
when he's been cruising among the gals all day, and comes hum
and cuddles up in bed at night. When he gits one gal stuck fast
in his head and his heart, as I had Judy White, he's as quiet as
a kitten, and his head's a sort a settled; but arter he's been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116] </a></span>roving over the world as I am a doing, his natur gits ruther rily,
and there's nothing that sticks in it except the dregs, the pure
essence sifting out all through.</p>

<p>Getting in love is somewhat like getting drunk, the more a
feller loves the more he wants tu,&mdash;and when the heart gits a
going, <em>pitty pat, pitty pat</em>, there is such a swell, that it busts
up all the strings, so that it can't hold the ginuine grit at all.
When Judy White fust took hold a my arm I give the coat sleeve
a rale hearty smack, where her hand had lain, and that coat I
raly did love better than any other I ever had on; but I never
think the better of my yaller gloves for shaking the hands of all
the gals in York. I've only got Miss Miles out of my head, to git
a thousand new shinin faces in. Lord knows what'll become of
me, Par, if I go on to be bedivilled arter the women, as I have
been this new year's day. When a feller is made any thing on by
'em he must have been brought up under good preaching in
Weathersfield to stand it here in York. I feel as if I shouldn't
be good for much afore long, myself, the way I am going on, but
to skoot up and down Broadway like that ere Count, and to hang
round gals' winders with fifes, and bassoons, and drums, and
gitars at night.</p>

<p>I can't look full into a purty gal's face all a flashing so, without
being kind a dazzled and scorched. It warms me up in
this cold weather, and kindles such a touse in my heart, that the
blood runs through it as hot as if it had scooted through a steamboat
pipe. And then the allfired critters have so many sly ways
of coming over a feller, that I don't think much of a man who
can see their purty mouths tremble, and not feel his tremble tu.
If they sidle up, I can't help sidling too if I died; and when
them black eyes fall flash on me, I wilt right down under
'em as cut grass in Weathersfield on a hot summer day. It is
natur all this, and I can't help it no how.</p>

<p>But you know, Par, I was brought up under good preaching,
and I go now to Dr. Spring's meeting always as straight as
Sunday comes round, and twice a day. If wimmin do snarl
up a feller's heart strings, though, they keep him out of other
scrapes, anybody will tell you that. A man that is in love a
leetle is not always a running into rum-holes, and other such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117] </a></span>places. He don't go a gambling, and isn't a sneakin round
nights.</p>

<p>Love, according to my notion on it, is a good anchor for us on
this 'ere voyage of life!&mdash;it brings us up so all a standing when
we put on too much sail. It puts me in mind, now I think on
it, of our cruise through Hell Gate in Captin Doolittle's sloop;
for jest as the tide and the wind was a carrying us on the rocks,
we dropt anchor and kept off. I look on the uses of women
purty much as I look on the freshet that in the spring brings
down the Connecticut the rale rich soil for the meadows in
Weathersfield. They make a great deal of splutter and fuss in
their spring-time, with their rustles and their ribbons, and their
fooleries, I know; but when they light on a feller for good, they
are the rale onion patches of his existence. Put us together,
and the soil will grow anything; but keep us apart, and we are
his thistles and nettles.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Visit to the Park Theatre&mdash;First Impressions of the Poetry of Motion,
as written on the air, in the aerial feats of Mademoiselle Celeste&mdash;First
shock at the exhibition of a Ballet Costume accompanied by
the "twinkles" of Celeste's feet&mdash;with her pigeon wings, double-shuffles,
gallopades, and pirouettes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>I've been a trying tu git time tu write you a letter this ever so
long; but somehow I've had so many parties tu go tu, besides
sleigh-rides, balls, and so on, that I haint known which eend my
head is on more than half the time. Besides all that, I've felt
kinder loth tu write you, for I aint jest sartin that you and marm
won't be in a pucker about what I've been a doing since I writ
tu you before. But I've got my pluck a stirring jest now; so
I'm detarmined tu up and tell you all right out, jest as it is&mdash;for
arter all, a feller must be a consarned coward that'll do a thing,
right or wrong, and then back out from owning on it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118] </a></span></p>
<p>Wal, t'other night Mr. Beebe he cum up tu my office about
sundown, and sez he, "Cousin Slick, supposing we go tu the
Park Theatre to-night, and see Madame Celeste dance."</p>

<p>My heart riz right up into my throat as he said this, for the
very idee of going tu the Theatre set me all over in a twitter.
Ever since I cum down here tu York, I've had an etarnal hankering
tu go and see some of their plays; but I tried all I could
tu pacify myself, and thought over more than forty times all the
preachings you used to make agin them&mdash;how you used tu say
they were filled with sinful devices and picters of the devil's own
painting, and that they warn't nothing more nor less than scraps
of the infarnal regions sot up here on arth tu delude away poor
mortals.</p>

<p>I wanted tu go awfully, but insted of giving in tu cousin John
when he fust come, I jest sot too and let off one of your preachments
to him; he didn't seem to mind it a mite, but, sez he,
"Cousin, would you think it right if a feller was tu cum out like
all blazes agin one of your letters in the <i>Express</i>, if he hadn't
read 'em?"</p>

<p>"I should like to ketch a feller at it&mdash;I should," sez I.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, "du you think it fair tu run out agin the
Theatres till you've seen something on 'em?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I don't know as it is; but haint my par an old
man as well as deacon of the church, and hadn't he ought tu
know? What's the use of a man's experience, if his children
won't profit by it, as long as he can't turn about and live his life
over agin?"</p>

<p>"That's true," sez cousin John; "but are you sartin that your
father was ever at a play in his life?"</p>

<p>"What, my par at the Theatre!" sez I, a holding up both
hands, "Mr. Zephaniah Slick, Esquire, Justice of the Peace and
Deacon of the Church, at the Theatre! Look a here, cousin
John, why don't you ask if he ever plays all fours, or 'I had as
many wives as the stars in the skies,'&mdash;he'd be about as likely tu
du one as t'other."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez John, sort of parsevering, "how can he judge
about them sort of things without he's seen 'em? Come, come,
jest put on your fix and let's go down."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119] </a></span></p>
<p>So with that he come his soft sodder so strong that I couldn't
hold out no longer, so I jest giv up, and we started off; but my
heart felt sort of queer all the way, for I couldn't keep from
thinking how you and marm would feel when you found out
where I'd been tu. I don't think there's anything very scrumptious
about the outside of the Theatre anyhow. Think sez I, as
I looked up tu it, if this is raly a temple of Old Nick, he haint
put himself out much tu finefy it off. A good many of the
meeting-houses here in York go ahead of this all tu nothing. It
looks more like a town hall or a tavern than any thing else that
I can think on.</p>

<p>When we got into the entry-way, cousin Beebe he took out a
dollar bill, and went up tu a little hole cut out in the wall, and
stuck in his hand, and sez he, "A ticket."</p>

<p>Think sez I, wal, if this don't beat all! They raly du mean tu
carry on all kinds of develtry; who'd a thought of finding one
of these darnation lottery offices here.</p>

<p>"You wont want a ticket," sez cousin John.</p>

<p>"No," sez I, "I guess I don't; if there's any thing on arth
that makes my blood bile, it's gambling." I was a going on tu
give him a piece of my mind, but jest then he pushed a door
open, all kivered over with green flannel, and give his paper tu a
tall man that stood there, looking as solemn as an owl in a
storm; and, sez he, a pinting tu me, this gentleman belongs tu
the press. The feller looked at me as sharp as a needle, and he
begun tu fumble over a paper, as if he didn't know exactly what
he wanted; but at last he held out his hand, and said it was
custom for the press to leave cards at the door. I never was so
struck up in my whole born days. Think sez I, wal, if this don't
beat all natur; they think because a feller is green enough tu go
tu the Theatre that he must play cards, and every thing else that's
bad. I shouldn't wonder, sez I tu myself, if he wants me tu begin
and cuss and swear next. I looked him right in his eyes, and put
my hands down in my pockets allfired hard, and, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look a here, you sir, I ain't no gambler&mdash;none of your foreign
chaps, that git their living by playing cards. You must be soft
in the upper story if you don't see that the first giffy. You
don't see no hair on my upper lip. I don't carry a cane with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120] </a></span>bagonet in it, nor wear checkered trousers, so you needn't ask
<em>me</em> to give you any cards, I haint touched one of the pesky
things since marm broke the tin dipper over my head for singing
out, 'high, low, Jack and the game, by gauley,' one day when I
and another little shaver got hid away in the corn-house a playing
all fours."</p>

<p>The feller opened his eyes a few when I said this, but three or
four finefied young fellers, with white gloves on, and little canes
in their hand, come to the door, and stood a grinning at me like
so many hungry monkeys. Cousin John spoke sort of low, and
sez he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is your name the man wants. If you haven't any cards,
write it out on a piece of paper."</p>

<p>With that the man handed over a piece of paper, and cousin
Beebe give me his gold pencil.</p>

<p>Think sez I, "If they will have my name, I'll give 'em a
smasher,"&mdash;so I flourished the "J" off with an allfired long tail,
and curlecued the "S" up till it looked like a black snake in the
sun. I ruther seem to think the feller stared a few when he saw
the name. The grinning chaps cum and looked at it, but made
themselves scarce in less than no time arter they had made it
out, and the tall chap, he bowed close down to the floor, and sez
he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Walk in, Mr. Slick, Mr. Simpson put your name on the free
list ever so long ago."</p>

<p>I was going to ask him to tell Mr. Simpson that I was very
much obligated, though I hadn't the least idea what he meant by
his free list, but that minit there was such a smashing of fiddles
and drums and toot-horns inside that I eenamost jumped out of
my skin. It seemed as if a dozen training bands had all been set
a going tu once.</p>

<p>Cousin John he took hold of my arm, and hauled me along
through a little door into a great big room built off more like a
meeting-house than anything else&mdash;and yet it wasn't like that
neither. It was shaped kinder like a horse shoe, the floor was
chuck full of benches, kivered over with red cushions, and there
was four galleries all pillared off and painted, and set off with
gold and great blazing glass things that made every thing look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121] </a></span>as bright as day. In the second gallery there were five or six
pens all boarded off from the rest, with lots of gold picters all
round them, and hung over with silk curtains, till they looked
more like the berths on board a steamboat than any thing I could
think on. These places were chuck full of allfired harnsome gals
and spruce looking fellers, that were dressed off to kill, and
talked and laughed as chipper as could be. The ruff was an etarnal
way up from the floor; it rounded up, and was crinkle-crankled
off with gold and picters till it looked like the West jest
afore sundown, when the red and yaller and purple lie in heaps
and ridges all over the sky.</p>

<p>Think sez I, if that's what par means by a device of the devil,
Old Nick is no slouch at putting the shine on the ruff of his
house, anyhow.</p>

<p>We sot down on one of the red benches in the lowest gallery,
and I got a leetle over the twitter that I was in at fust, and jest
made up my mind to look amongst the folks to see what was
going on.</p>

<p>It warn't a mite of wonder that the musicianers made me
jump so when I was in the entry way, for clear on t'other eend of
the room was a long pen chuck full and running over with fiddlers,
base drums, and great brass horns, all pulling and blowing
and thumping away like all natur; didn't they send out the
music!&mdash;never on arth did I hear any thing like it! It made me
choke and sigh and ketch my breath like a dying hen; and all I
could du, my feet would keep going over the steps, and my yaller
gloves seemed as if they never would git still agin, they kept so
busy a beating time on the leg of my new trousers. Jest over
the pen where the fiddlers sot, hung a great picter as big as the
side of a house. I thought of what you said about theatres being
filled with picters of the devil's own painting; but I couldn't
make up my mind that that was one on 'em, for it was so green
and cold, and a pale man, pictered out on a heap of stuns in the
middle on it, looked as shivery as if he'd had a fit of the fever
and ague&mdash;besides there was water painted out, and every body
knows that Old Scratch aint tee-total enough to paint a picter
chuck full of clouds and water and sich like, without one spark
of fire to make him feel to hum in his own premises.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122] </a></span></p>
<p>By-am-by sich sights of the people, all dressed off as if they were
a going to a general training ball, kept a pouring in through the
leetle doors in the galleries till the seats were all chuck full; such
a glistening of harnsome eyes and feathers, and flowers, I never
did see. A purty leetle gal cum and sot close down by me, and
now and then I took a slanting squint at her; by hokey, she was
a slick leetle critter, with the consarnedest soft eyes I ever looked
into.</p>

<p>I wonder what on arth is the reason that I can't sit down by
a harnsome gal, but my heart will begin to flounder about like a
fish jest arter he's hooked. Think, sez I, if there's any dancing
a going on to-night, darn me if I don't shin up to that gal for a
partner. But, where on arth the folks were a going tu find a
place to dance in I couldn't make out, for in the hull building
there warn't room enough tu hang up a flax-seed edgeways.</p>

<p>I was jest a going tu ask cousin John about it, when the fiddles
pulled up a minit, and all tu once that great picter give a twitch,
and up it went like a streak of chalk, into the ruff, or the Lord
knows where. I jumped right on eend, I was so struck with
what I see.</p>

<p>Clear back where the curtain had been was a purty little garden,
as nat'ral as one of our onion patches. It was chuck full of
trees and flowers, and a snug leetle house stood on one side;
clear back, jest under the edge of the sky, lay the soft water,
looking as blue and still as could be. What to make on it I
couldn't tell; it warn't like a picter, and yet I couldn't think
how on arth there could be room enough tu have sich a place
near the theatre. While I sot there a bending for'ard with one
of my yaller gloves pressed down on each knee, and staring like
a stuck pig with my mouth a leetle open, a lot of folks dressed
off in short jackets and trousers cut off at the knees, come a
dancing out of the house, and begun tu talk all at once, and
chatter and laugh together as chipper as a flock of birds. They
seemed as happy as clams in high water; and the fellers skipped
and hung round the gals like good fellers.</p>

<p>But the gals were dressed out too bad. I'll be darned if some
of 'em didn't make me feel streaked, their frocks were so short.
They didn't seem tu make no bones of showing their legs half-way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123] </a></span>tu their knees. I swanny if I wasn't ashamed of the purty
gal that sot by me. Think sez I, if she don't blush and feel all
overish I'm mistaken. Arter a while, I give her a slantidicular
squint, but she sot as still as a kitten, and looking as if butter
wouldn't melt in her mouth, but was a staring right straight at
the garden without seeming to mind the gals' legs a bit more
than if they had been so many broom sticks.</p>

<p>It warn't a great while afore I didn't seem to mind it much
either, for a little old comical looking chap come out in front of
the garden, and begun to chatter and larf, and fling his arms
about every which way, and to tell about some young gal that
was a going to be married. Madeline, he called her.</p>

<p>Wal, while he was a talking, a feller, all in red regimentals,
come round the house, as big as my pussey cousin, with a set of
letters in his hand, and blowing a tin toot-horn, as if he wanted
us all tu come tu dinner. He turned to be a sort of post-rider,
with letters; he give one to the funny old chap that owned the
house, but it only had another letter in it, and that was for the
gal that was a going tu be married.</p>

<p>I begun to feel awful curious tu see that gal, arter hearing
them talk about her so much; but the post-office feller cut up
his shines, and ordered the folks about as obstroperous as my
pussey cousin; a prime chap he was&mdash;and I took a sort of a
notion to him, he acted out so slick.</p>

<p>By-am-by in come the purtyest looking critter that ever I did
see; she walked and sidled through the garden like a bird among
the green trees, and her voice sounded so funny when she spoke;
she kinder cut her words off, and lisped 'em out so sweet, that
every word sounded chuck full of honey. I swan it made my
heart rise right up in my mouth every time she spoke. She had
tarnal harnsome eyes, as bright as the biggest star in the gill-dipper,
and I could almost tell what she was a saying by the cut
of her face; I never did see a critter look so happy. She had
the cunningest leetle white hat that I ever did see, stuck on one
side of her head, with blue ribbons streaming from it over her
shoulders; on t'other side her long shiny curls hung down on her
shoulders, and a harnsome white rose was stuck in them back of her
ear; but it didn't seem much whiter than her forehead and neck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124] </a></span>for they were as white as the froth on a pail of new milk afore
it is strained. She had on a blue silk frock, cut off a leetle too
short at the bottom, for my notion, and her cunning leetle feet
raly cut about in them new shoes a leetle <em>too</em> spry; I never did
see anything so subtle as she was in my life.</p>

<p>The minit she came into the garden, all the folks in the galleries,
and on the seats below, begun to stomp, and yell, and holler,
till I was afeard that I made a mistake, and got into a political
meeting agin. She began to curchy, and lay her hand on her
bosom, and curchy agin, all the while a looking so sweet and
mealy-mouthed that I wanted to eat her hull, I swow I did.
Arter a while they begun to get tired of making sich etarnal
coots of themselves, and then she begun to go round among the
folks in the garden, and give them presents, because she was a
going to git married in the morning, tu a rich gentleman that
lived close by.</p>

<p>All tu once the comical old chap called "Madeline!" and
give her the letter the post-rider had brought for her.</p>

<p>Arter she'd gone into the house, he begun to tell the folks all
about her&mdash;how she was a poor leetle French gal that he'd
undertook tu bring up and keep out of harm, when everybody
in her country was afeard of their lives&mdash;and how she'd got a
brother yet in France, whose life wouldn't be worth four-pence-half-penny
if he should once set foot over in England; for they
made believe that all this garden and things was a going on in
England.</p>

<p>Wal, arter they'd all gone in, out come Madeline agin with the
letter in her hand. I swanny, but I couldn't help but feel for
the poor critter. She looked as if she'd been crying her eyes
out, but she kept a kissing the letter and reading it sort of loud,
and a crying all the time, so that we all found out it come from
her brother, and that he was a coming tu take her away with
him in the morning; and it seemed to make her feel bad
because he didn't know that she was a going to be married then.
When she'd read her letter through, she went into the house
agin, looking as peaked and wamble-cropped as a sick lamb.</p>

<p>When the picter was rolled up agin, the garden was all gone,
and there sot the purty leetle Madeline in a room with a chest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125] </a></span>open by her filled with wimmen's clothing, and there was a rale
harnsome young feller a standing by her that she seemed so
fond of, and that she called her brother.</p>

<p>While they were talking together, and afore she had time to
tell him she was a going to be married, there was an allfired
noise outside of the door, and you never see a cat jump up
spryer than she did. She turned as white as a sheet, and wrung
her leetle hands, and seemed more than half crazy, for she said
the officers had cum arter her brother to hang him for a spy.
She hugged him one minit, and then she'd wring her hands, and
look round so anxious for some place to hide him in. At last she
run to the chest, pulled all the clothes out on it, and made him
git in there&mdash;she put them all back agin, and kivered it over
with a great red shawl. She hadn't but jest sot down and took
up her sewing work, when a great etarnal coot of a feller, that
made my blood bile every time I looked at him, cum into the
room along with another feller, and begun to sarch arter the
poor young chap that she'd hid away.</p>

<p>We could see that the poor gal was eenamost scared out of
her senses, for she turned as white as a ghost&mdash;but she cocked
one foot over t'other, and went on a sewing as fast as could be.
I swanny, it made me wrathy tu hear the varmint how he run
on agin the poor gal. I never did see sich wicked eyes as hisen
were in my life, nor sich a ragged drunken looking shark; it
made my grit rise every time he looked towards that sweet
gal.</p>

<p>The officer couldn't find nobody, and wanted to go hum, but
the tall shack went up to the chest, and begun to poke about
among the clothes, and asked what she'd got there. She looked
as if she would go off the handle at that; but she didn't give
up. Arter a minit she jumped up and took up a gown and
showed it to the officer, and then she took up a shawl and told
him it was her wedding shawl, and she began to run on and
smile, and talk so coaxing, and spread out the shawl all the
time, till the young feller in the chest crept out and got into
another room, while she held the shawl afore him. They went
off grumbling, and consarnedly wamble-cropped, for a reward
had been offered for the purty French gal's brother, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126] </a></span>etarnal scamp meant tu git his revenge on her and money tu
boot.</p>

<p>I was a looking steady into the room, when all tu once it slid
away, and there was the garden agin, and the outside of the
house, and it was dark as midnight among the bushes. By-am-by
out came the ragged scamp and stood jest under the poor
French gal's winder, to see what was a going on, and while he
was there, the good-hearted chap, that she was a going tu be
married tu, came along tu look at her winder, as fellers will
when they are over head and ears in luv.</p>

<p>Then the French gal cum to the winder, and the young feller that
she'd been a hiding away, jumped out, and she put his cloak on and
hugged him as if her heart was eenamost ready to bust. When
she see her brother clear off she went back tu bed, but the squire
and the ragged scamp had seen her, and sich a row as it kicked
up never was heard on afore.</p>

<p>In a little while there was sich a hubbub in the garden; all
the wimmen that she'd gin presents tu, got together, and begun
to run out agin her, and saying that they always thought she
was no better than she ought tu be. The squire said he wouldn't
marry her, and the tarnal old man turned her out of doors.</p>

<p>I thought I should a boo-hooed right out, when I see her cum
out of the door with a bundle in her hand, a crying as if she
hadn't a friend on arth. She was a going away so slow and sorrowful,
when the squire cum up and offered her some money, for
he seemed tu feel sorry for her, though he thought she'd been a
cheating him.</p>

<p>She looked at him so still, and yit so proud, as if her heart
was brim full of grief, but she wouldn't take his money. At
last he told her that the man she'd had was took prisoner. Oh,
how she did take on then! She wrung her hands, and sobbed,
and cried enough tu make one feel wamble-cropped to see her,
and she said now that her character was gone and her brother
taken, that she wanted to die.</p>

<p>The squire felt dreadfully when he found out that the man was
her brother. So he made up with her, and she got on tu a horse
and rode off full chisel tu get her brother's pardon.</p>

<p>By-am-by she got back with the pardon for her brother, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127] </a></span>there was such crying and kissing and shaking hands, as you
never heard on. I bellered right out a crying, I was so allfired
glad tu see the poor gal happy once more.</p>

<p>Wal, by-am-by, a bell tinkled; the picter rolled up agin and
the fiddlers begun to put on elbow grease till the music came
out slick enough. Instead of the garden there was a long ball-room
with rows of great shiney pillars running all through it.
It was as light as day, for there seemed to be candles out of sight
among the pillars, besides a row of lamps that stood along the
pen where the musicianers sot. I was staring with all the eyes I
had in my head, when the harnsomest critter I ever sot eyes on
cum flying into the middle of the room, and there she stood on
one foot with her arms held out and her face turned towards us,
looking as bold, and smiling as soft as if she'd never done nothing
else all her life. I was so scared when she fust sprung in,
that I raly didn't know which een my head was on. The darned
critter was more than half naked&mdash;she was, by golley! To save
my life I couldn't look at her right straight with that blue-eyed
gal a setting close by me. At fust I was so struck up that I
couldn't see nothing but an allfired harnsome face a smiling from
under a wreath of flowers, and naked legs and arms and neck, a
flying round like a live wind-mill. I thought I should go off the
handle at fust&mdash;I felt sort of dizzy, and as if I was blushing all
over. I don't think I ever was in such an etarnal twitter in my
hull life. I partly got up tu go out, and then I sot down agin as
streaked as lean pork, and kivered my face with my yaller
gloves, but somehow I couldn't hold my hands still all I could
du&mdash;the fingers would git apart, so that I couldn't help but look
through them at that plaguey, darned harnsome, undecent critter,
as she jumped and whirled and stretched her naked arms
out toward us, and stood a smiling and coaxing and looking tu the
fellers. It was enough to make a feller cuss his mother because
she was a woman; but I'll be darned if there ever was a feller on
arth that could help looking at the critter.</p>

<p>I've seen a bird charmed by a black snake, but it was nothing
tu this&mdash;not a priming. One minute she'd kinder flutter round the
room softly and still like a bird that's jest beginning tu fly, then
she'd stand on one foot and twinkle t'other out and in against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128] </a></span>the ankle so swift you couldn't but jest see it. Then she'd hop
for'ard and twist her arms up on her bosom, and stick one leg
out behind her, and stand on one toe for ever so long, till all on
us had had a fair sight on her that way. Then she'd take
another hop and pint her right toe forward, and lift it higher,
till by-am-by round she'd go like a top, with her leg stuck out
straight and whirling round and round like the spoke of a broken
waggin with a foot tu it. It raly did beat all that I ever did
see. When she stood up straight, her white frock was all
sprigged off with silver, and it looked like a cloud of snow, but
it didn't reach half way down tu her knees, and stuck out dreadfully
behind. I hadn't dared to unkiver my face yet, and was
sort of trembling all over in a dreadful pucker, wondering what
on arth she meant tu do next, when she give a whirl, kissed her
hand, and hopped away as spry as a cricket, jest as she came in.</p>

<p>I swan, if I didn't think I never should breathe straight agin;
I raly wouldn't a looked in that purty blue-eyed gal's face for
anything; but somehow I happened tu squint that way, for I felt
kinder anxious tu see how red a gal could blush, and there she
sot a smiling and a looking as she raly liked the fun. She was
whispering to a young feller that sot t'other side, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aint it beautiful! Oh! I hope they'll call her back!"</p>

<p>"She will come, I dare say," sez the feller a larfin, and beginning
to stomp and clap hands with the rest on 'em that were a
yelling and hooting like all possessed. "Celeste treats the Americans
very much as a lover does his lady."</p>

<p>"How so?" sez the gal, looking sort of puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why, she can't leave them without coming back again and
again to take <em>farewell</em>!" sez he, a larfin; "but here she
comes!"</p>

<p>True as a book, there she did cum, and begun tu sidle and
whirl, and cut up her crancums all over agin. By leetle and
leetle I let my hands slide down from my face, and when she
give her prime whirl and stuck out her toe the last time, I sot a
staring right straight at her, so astonished I couldn't set still,
for as true as you live, the nice, leetle French gal that was so
sweet and modest, and the bold, beautiful critter with her foot
out, her arms a wavering around her head, and her mouth jest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129] </a></span>open enough tu show her teeth, was the same individual critter,
and both on 'em were Madame Celeste.</p>

<p>I went hum. But I'll be choked if them legs and arms, and
that frock with the flowers over it didn't whirl round in my
head all night, and they ain't fairly out yit.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan receives an Invitation to a Fancy Ball&mdash;Dilemma about
the Dress&mdash;Choice of a Character, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>I du think this ere trade of writing is about the darndest
bisness that a feller ever took to. The minit a man begins tu
git his name up here in York, the way the gals du haul him
over the coals is a sin to Crocket, as they say down here. They
talk about the Yankees having a nack of cheating people out of
their eye teeth. By gracious! if the York folks don't know
how to hold up ther end of the yoke at that trade, I'm a coot,
that's all. They may take my grinders and welcome, but I'll be
darn'd if I give up my Christian name, without making an
all-fired rumpus about it. I can't go down Cherry-street now
without somebody's stopping me to find out who writes my
letters, jest as if I didn't write 'em myself. Some on 'em seem
to think it's a Portland chap, an allfired smart critter, that come
from down East, and that's been a writing a capital history of
the war down on the territory that haint got no boundary; and
people keep a coming to the Express office every once in a
while, to find out if Major Jack Downing don't write 'em and
sign my name. I should like to ketch him at it once! Let him
or any other chap put my name to any thing that I don't write,
and if I don't lick him within an inch of his life, then he may
steal my name and welcome.</p>

<p>Now, jest to git the York people out of the etarnal twitter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130] </a></span>that they're in to find out who writes my letters, I've made up
my mind to tell 'em here, in one of my letters; and if I don't
tell 'em the truth, I hope I may be hung and choked to death,
so there!</p>

<p>In the first place, I aint intimate with Major Jack Downing,
and never sot eyes on him in my life, till t'other night at "the
Grand Fancy Ball," as they call it. He's a smart chap, but I'll
be darned if he ever writ a word of one of my letters in his life,&mdash;and
more than all that, he don't know me from Adam; no
more does the Portland chap, or any of the rest on 'em,&mdash;and I
du think it's allfired hard, if I can't have the credit of writing
letters on my own hook, and nobody's else. Now these two
chaps are prime fellers, and old hands at the bisness; but I
never tried my hand at writing a letter in my hull life, till I
sent the fust one to the Express&mdash;and that I put my name tu as
large as life. Neither the Portland Major Jack Downing, nor
the New York Major Jack Downing, nor our Sam, nor nobody
else, has a finger in my dish; but all the letters that has my
name and picter to 'em are writ by me.</p>

</div>

<p>That's my card! as they say at the theatre,&mdash;and now I hope
the Yorkers wont pester me any more, to know who I am.</p>

<p>Arter going to the Park Theatre t'other night, I begun to
feel sort of dissatisfied with the carryings on in this place, and I
eenamost made up my mind to come back to Weathersfield and
stick to the old business for life. Somehow I couldn't git them
naked legs and arms, and so on, of Marm-sel Celeste out of my
head,&mdash;and I couldn't help feeling awful streaked when I
thought of them in the day-light. Sich sights aint fit for any
thing but candle-light, and then a feller must be half corned
before he can see them without feeling ashamed of all womankind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131] </a></span></p>
<p>I du think, when a chap begins to have a bad opinion of the
wimmin folks, it's a sign that there is something out of the way
in his own heart; but it comes tough to keep a feller's heart in
the right place, while sich sweet, purty, indecent critters as
that Celeste, are a kicking up their heels and flinging all sorts
of queer ideas into his mind. Arter seeing her flurish her white
short gown, without petticoat, afore all them folks, I begun to
hate the gals like pison; it seemed to me as if they warn't made
for men's wives, or tu be mothers and sister's. It was a hull
week afore I could make up my mind to go out of my office,
and the sight of a furbelow raly made me sick. I began to rale
out agin all the feminine gender like all natur.</p>

<p>Wal, one morning I got up, and sat down by the stove, with
my legs stretched out, and my hands fingering the loose coppers
in my trousers' pocket, when Cousin John come in, looking as
tickled as a puppy dog.</p>

<p>"See here, Jonathan," sez he, "I've got an invitation, for you
to go to a fancy ball to-night, clear up town, so I've come to see
what you'll wear, and all about it."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, kinder melancholy, "I've got eenamost tired of
sich things; it raly don't seem to agree with me frolicking so
much, but I suppose I may as well go."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez cousin, "what do you mean to wear?"</p>

<p>"What du I mean tu wear?" sez I, "why, my new clothes
sartinly: I ruther guess all the shine haint worn off from them
yit, by a great sight."</p>

<p>"Yes," sez he, "but you must go in character to this ball."</p>

<p>"Look a here, cousin," sez I, a rilin up a leetle, "I don't know
as you've ever seen me go to any place that was out of character
yit, so you needn't say that."</p>

<p>John, he colored up and larfed a leetle, and sez he, "Don't git
wrothy, Jonathan&mdash;I didn't mean nothing, but the fact is, it will
be best for you to dress in something a leetle different to your
common clothes. Supposing you dress like a Turk?"</p>

<p>"What! like one of them chaps that keep a hull caravan of
wives shut up in their housen?" sez I. "I'm much obligated to
you for the idee&mdash;but I'd a leetle ruther not. I'd jest as lives go
to sleep and dream I was a gad fly in a black hornet's nest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132] </a></span></p><p>"Wal," sez he, "supposin you let me dress you up like an
Injun&mdash;how would you like that? I'll dress Mary up like a
squaw, and you can walk in together."</p>

<p>"Why," sez I, sort of puzzled to find out what he was at, "I'd
ruther be an Injun any day than be one of them tarnal Turky
fellers; but what will the folks think of us if we come fixed out
so? I should feel as streaked as a piece of ribbongrass, I'm sartin."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind that, they'll be glad to have you come like
an Injun; you don't know what a sight of folks are a going.
There'll be Kings and Queens, nuns, Scotch ladies, Englishmen,
and women born two hundred years ago, and all sorts of people."</p>

<p>"Gracious gaully how you talk!" sez I, all in amaze, for he
seemed as arnest as an ox team.&mdash;"Why, they haint sent invites
over the water, have they?"</p>

<p>"You'll see," sez John, a larfin a leetle easy, and rubbing his
hands. "But I want a favor,&mdash;wont you lend me them old clothes
of yours to go in?"</p>

<p>"What, old blue, with the shiney buttons, and the pepper and
salt trousers!" sez I. "Wal now, I'd jest as lives you had 'em
as not? but raly if you want to slick up, hadn't you better take
the new fix, it'll look a good deal more scrumptious?"</p>

<p>"No," sez he, "I want them that your picter was took in,
they're jest the thing."</p>

<p>"They'll fit you to a notch," sez I. "The trousers may be a
leetle too short, but I can get the gallus buttons sot on strong,
and the pockets are nation handy."</p>

<p>"Do," sez he, "and I'll git your dress. Come up to our house,
and, we'll all start together."</p>

<p>With that John he went away, and I sot down all in a flustration
to try and make out what he wanted me to fix up like a
born Injun for; but the more I tho't the more I got in a pucker
about it, so I jest give it up, and stopped thinking about it as
much as I could.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan Slick and the Grand Fancy Ball&mdash;Jonathan in the character
of an Injun, and Cousin Beebe in the character of Jonathan&mdash;Cousin
Mary as Jonathan's Squaw&mdash;Jonathan among Kings and
Queens, Spaniards, Turks and Jews&mdash;Jonathan meets his pussey
Cousin in the character of a Turk&mdash;Jonathan cuts his pussey
Cousin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Wal, Thursday, jest afore dark, I bundled up old blue, and the
pepper and salt trousers, and pulled foot for Cousin Beebe's as
chirk as a grass-hopper. The nigger set me in and took me up
stairs to a little room, where John was sittin in a great chair,
with the tarnationest heap of feathers and things about him that
ever you did see. He jumped up as soon as he saw me with
the bundle under my arm, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, hurry now and get off your things, I want to paint
you." With that he come along with a saucer of red stuff, and
begun to stir it up mighty savage.</p>

<p>Wal, think sez I, that don't look over inviting&mdash;but I s'pose
I may as well die for an old sheep as a lamb; so I took
off my coat, and unbuckled my stock, and let him brush away.
Didn't he snake on the paint though! Think sez I, I don't
know how I shall feel&mdash;but if I don't look streaked, it wont be
the fault of this ere leetle brush any how. Arter a while he
begun to ri-bob-skew my hair up on the top of my head; I
raly couldn't but jest wink, he drew it so tight; but I grinn'd
and bore it as well as I could. By-am-by he made me put on a
red shirt, and sich a heap of nigger gimcracks as would've made
you larf only jest to look at. When he'd tied, and pinned, and
stuck on all the feathers he could find, he told me to get up and
look in the glass. Gauly-oppalus&mdash;what a darn'd lookin critter
I was! I raly thought I should a bust, I larfed so; my hair was
all girt on the top of my head, and a hull grist of red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134] </a></span>feathers stuck into it every which way, till my head looked like
an allfired great beet, a running to seed&mdash;my face was painted a
sort of a brick color, with two or three streaks of black and yaller,
to make it look lively; I had on a sort of a leather nightgown,
without any sleeves&mdash;all fringed off with beads, and
feathers, and quills, that made a noise every time I moved, like
the loose ice rattling off a tree arter a freezing rain; besides the
legs of a pair of leather trousers, that only come up to my knees,
but they were fringed and finefied off to kill, I can tell you.
The shoes were smashers, though they sot to my feet as slick as
a biscuit, and felt as soft as a silk weed pod. You never saw
anything worked off so&mdash;purty leetle shiney beads glistened all
over with them, and they were kivered all over with flowers,
and spangled off with silver, till they took the shine off eenamost
anything I ever did see.</p>

<p>I don't know what got into me, but the minit I got the Injun
toggery on, I begun to feel as subtle and slimpsey as an eel, and
the way I flourished about and kicked up my heels, beat Miss
Celeste all to nothing. I raly thought Cousin John would a died
a larfin. "Look a here," sez he, "don't kick up a pow-wow till
you get to the ball. Did you ever see a rale full-blooded
Injun?"</p>

<p>"I ruther surmise so," sez I.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, "du you think you can act one out?"</p>

<p>"Can't I! Look a here&mdash;don't I du it as slick as a whistle?"
sez I, and with that I looked as savage as a meat-axe, and begun
to strut up and down the room like a turkey-gobbler on the
sunny side of a barn-yard.</p>

<p>"That'll du," sez John; "now you must have some medicine."</p>

<p>"I'll bet a copper I don't, though," sez I; "I despise all kinds
of doctor-stuff, and if you git any o' your rhubarb, or calomel, or
Brandreth's pills down me I'll lose my guess."</p>

<p>Here John went off the handle agin, like a broken coffee mill,
and the way he did tee-hee was enough to make a feller's dander
rise.</p>

<p>"Look a here," sez I, a walking straight up to him, "you
needn't larf, nor try to come your soft sodder over me. I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135] </a></span>believe its the fashion to take pills here in York, afore a chap
goes to a ball; and I won't do it. There now, I've sot down my
foot."</p>

<p>It was a good while afore John could ketch his breath; but
arter all he gin up&mdash;and, sez he, "Here, you haint no objections
to carrying this thing, and calling it medicine, have you?"</p>

<p>"Not the least in natur," sez I,&mdash;and with that I took a sort
of a young woodchuck skin, stuffed out till it looked nat'ral as
life, and I tucked it under my arm, and went down stairs to see
how Cousin Mary looked.</p>

<p>As sure as a gun there she sot all dressed out to kill&mdash;her hair
was braided in great long tails, and all hung over with silver and
gold, and leetle bunches of red feathers. A row of short red
and yaller and blue feathers went round her head, and was twisted
together on one side, with a gold cord that had two long tossels
made out of gold and leetle shiney beads, that hung glistening
over her shoulder as bright as a handful of ripe currents, when
the sun strikes 'em.</p>

<p>I swow, but Mary did make a purty leetle squaw&mdash;her frock
was made out of the whitest leather you ever did see, and was
kinder like my no-sleeved coat, only a great deal harnsomer and
hull all round. It didn't come clear down to her feet and that
tarnal leetle foot and ankle of her'n did cut a swath in the leetle
glistening shoes and them figgered silk stockings. It raly made
me ketch my breath to look at her, she was so consarned harnsome.
I thought I should a bust when cousin Beebe came into the
room in my old blue coat and pepper and salts, with his hat
stuck on the back of his head, and his hands in his pockets. It
was me all over, cow-hide boots, red hankercher and all.</p>

<p>By-am-by the nigger come in and said that the carriage was at
the door, so we all up and got into it about the quickest, and off
we driv full split up town, till we come to a whopper of a house
clear up to Seventeenth street. When we got eenamost there,
the horses couldn't but jest git along, there was sich a grist of
carriages streaking it one arter another toward the house. They
put me in mind of a string of onions jest broke loose, they were
so tarnal thick.</p>

<p>Arter a good while we driv chuck up to the stun walk that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136] </a></span>a lot of tow sheets stretched out over it to keep folks dry, and
went right straight up to the stoop, where a couple of spruce-looking
chaps with red ribbons stuck in their button holes, come
up and took us through a great long entry way, where the lights
eenamost dazzled a feller's eyes, to a sort of a twistified pair of
stairs.</p>

<p>I kinder wanted to stop by a stun table, sot off in the back part
of the entry way, and take a swig of punch, but I hadn't time to
git a hull swaller afore John and Mary were half way up stairs,
so I pulled foot and went arter 'em sort of wamblecropped at
having to choke off from the punch, for it was the rale critter, I
can tell you.</p>

<p>Mary she went into a great harnsome room, chuck full, and
running over with gals, for I took a sly peak through the door as
she went in, jest to see what was a going on; and then Cousin
Beebe and I went into another room, and walked round till she
cum out agin. Down we went through the entry way till we
come to a door at the further eend.</p>

<p>"Why don't you give Mary your arm?" sez John to me, jest
as I was walking along toward the door.</p>

<p>"If I'm to play Injun to-night," sez I, "I'll do it according to
my own notion if you'd jest as livs. I never see an Injun and
squaw a hooking arms yet,&mdash;so cousin Mary may jest walk behind
me, if she aint too stuck up."</p>

<p>With that I tucked the woodchuck under my arm, and walked
right straight ahead as stiff as a crowbar. Gracious me! what a
smasher of a room we went into&mdash;it was all set off with yaller
and blue settees and benches, and every sich thing, eenamost as
slick as my pussey cousin's room, and the darndest set of critters
were a dancing and a sidling about that ever I did see. There
warn't no carpet on the boards, and if they'd a been a mind tu,
they might have shinned it down about right, but instead of that
they went curchying and scooting about, jest like so many tom
tits on the bank of a river. It raly made my grit rise to see a set
of folks come from all the four quarters of the globe, to a party,
that didn't know how to dance an eight reel or munny-muss as
it ought to be done. They didn't seem to mind us when we went
in, or else I should a felt awful streaked a standing up there like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137] </a></span>a darned Injun, with Mary by me. I felt sartin of not being
known, and so I kept a purty stiff upper lip, and looked on jest
to see how foreign gentry acted when they were tu hum. There
was a swad of tarnal harnsome wimmen in the middle of the
room curchying and twistifying and wriggling about one another,
and making believe dance like all natur. But, oh forever! how
they were dressed out! One on 'em had on a great long black
silk cloak, with sleeves to it, and a sort of white bib hanging
down before, for fear she'd spill the wine and sweet sarce on to
her dress when she eat, I s'pose, and she looked sort a like a nice
harnsome chap, and sort a like a gal, kinder half and half, like a
fence politician. There was a gal close by her dressed out to kill;
her shoes were tied on with red ribbons, over a leetle stuck up
foot, that looked good enough to eat; and she had on three open
dresses, one over t'other, made out of white silk and thin shiny
stuff, bound and trimmed off with strips of gold; the sleeves
hung down like a feller's shirt, but there warn't no ristband to
'em, and they hung wide open, so that her pesky white arm shone
out enough to dazzle a feller's eyes. She had two allfired great
breast pins, one on 'em spread out like a sun on her bosom, and
another down to her waist, all sot chuck full of stuns, that kept
a glistening in the light, like a handful of sparks out of a blacksmith's
chimney. She wore another of these glistening leetle
suns on her harnsome white forehead; her long shiney curls hung
down on her shoulders, and a white veil, that looked like a cloud
with the sunshine a pouring into it, dropped over them. I
whispered to cousin Mary, and asked who the darned likely critter
could be. She said she come from Peru, and was a priestess,
or something, of the sun. Before I could get a chance to ask
whose son it was that she preached tu, and to say that I shouldn't
grumble if sich a critter as that should preach a trifle easy to Mr.
Zepheniah Slick's son&mdash;up come a leetle black-eyed gal, about
knee high to a toad, with a stick in her hand, and curls a hanging
all over her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Hellow," sez I, "none of that are," as she hit my woodchuck
a dab with the stick, and run off larfin, ready to bust her leetle
sides. Before I knew which eend my head was on, up comes
another set of leetle queer looking gals, so young that they didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138] </a></span>seem much more than babies, that ought to have been spanked
and put to bed, instead of being there. They were dressed off in
short frocks, and glistened like a hail storm; but where they
come from I couldn't tell, for they all had wings on their
shoulders, and I never read of such winged critters on this arth,
and it didn't seem as if children would be sent from t'other
world to a York ball. Before I could say Jack Robinson, they
made themselves scarce, and then sich sights of men and wimmen
cum a walking about, some dressed like angels jest dropped
down, some in regimentals, and all sorts of ways, that ever a feller
dreamed of. I swan, if I didn't begin to git dizzy with looking
at 'em.</p>

<p>I kept by the door yit, a huggin my woodchuck, and a wonderin
how on arth the man that gave the party made out to send
round to all parts of the world to git his folks together, when I
happened to give a squint towards cousin Beebe, and I bust right
out a larfin, all I could du to help it. There he stood with his
mouth sort of open, and both hands dug down into the pockets
of my old pepper and salts, a staring about like a stuck pig.
Arter a minit, he went up to the slick leetle gal, right from
Spain, with shiney black hair, eyes as bright as a hawk's, and a
great long black veil a streaming down her back, and he made a
bow and asked her to dance as genteel as I could a done myself.
Pokehontas! but didn't he make the old cowhides flurish about.
The way he balanced up and played heel and toe back agin, was
Weathersfield all over. The old blue and pepper and salts had
put the grit into him about right. I don't believe he'd felt so
nat'ral afore since he left Connecticut. I thought Mary would a
gone off the handle, she was so tickled, and I had to go away to
keep from haw-hawing right out.</p>

<p>I went along through a great wide door into a room all set
off with blue, that had a pen full of fiddlers at the further eend,
where some folks from Turkey and Amsterdam were a whirling
the foreign gals round and round like so many horses a grinding
cider. I couldn't look at 'em without feeling my dander rise,
yet I couldn't help but be sort of glad that the great people
from foreign parts made as tarnal coots of themselves as we du
here to hum. There wasn't a gal dressed out like a true born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139] </a></span>American among 'em; but the way they did flirt round with
the men a hugging them, and the light a pouring down from the
heaps of glass and white candles over head, was as bad as I ever
see in a rale York party. It kinder made me dizzy to look on,
so I jest turned my back and begun to take an observation of
the consarned harnsome picters that hung agin the wall and listened
to the music that come a streaming from the fiddle and
horns and bass viols as slick as a streak of chalk iled at both
eends. By-am-by I seemed to git tired of that, so up I went to
see if I couldn't find out where the Kings and Queens had hid
to; for I had a kind of a hankerin notion to see what kind of
stuff they were made on.</p>

<p>Wal, I went along the entry-way, only jest stopping time
enough to take a swig of drink from the stun table, till I got
into a room where they kept the Kings and Queens. The light
come down almighty powerful over the great thick red carpet,
and the settees and foot-stools and chairs glistened out like a bed
of tulips in a hot sun. But the Queens, it raly did make me
ketch my breath to look on 'em. Sich consarned beautiful critters
I never did see. They beat all horned cattle that ever I sot
eyes on. One on 'em sot on a foot-stool, with her feet sort of
crossed in a letter X. She had shiney trousers on, all spangled
off, and a kind of a silk frock-coat puckered up awfully at the
waist, with a lot of them shiney stuns round her neck, and on
her arms, and among her thick hair, and all over, till she glistened
as if she'd been out among a storm of firebugs. There
was a leetle hump-backed critter of a man, all finefied off with
satins, and feathers, and velvet, and gold; but a darn'd queer
shote he was for a king! So I jest went by him, and the odd
looking Queen squat on the foot-stool that he was a talking to,
as chipper as could be, and sidled sort of bashful, woodchuck
and all, up to a tall, harnsome, stuck-up looking Queen, that
stood a talking to a chap with a great long feather in his cap,
that they called a Night. She had on a great long shiney velvet
dress, that streamed out behind like the tail of a comet, and
round her beautiful head was a rale ginuine crown, that seemed
as if it struck fire every time she moved her head; it raly made
my eyes snap to look on it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140] </a></span></p>
<p>Think sez I to myself, "Wal, I never did speak to a Queen
yit&mdash;but, by gaully! I'll have a try at it this time&mdash;Injun or no
Injun."</p>

<p>I didn't exactly know how to begin, but I'd heard say that
folks always got down on their marrow bones when they spoke
to sich stuck up quality; and think sez I, what's manners for a
white man, must be manners for an Injun. So I went whop
down on my knees, and sez I&mdash;"Look a here, Marm Queen,
shouldn't you like a nation well to have a look at a rale prime
Yankee woodchuck? They are curious critters, I call tell you!"</p>

<p>With that, I held up the consarned little critter, and begun to
stroke down his back as if he'd been a pussy cat.</p>

<p>The Queen kinder jumped and stepped back, and said, "Oh,
my!" and a leetle finefied boy, dressed off to kill, that stood
behind her a holding up the eend of her frock, he begun to
snicker, and at last he tee-heed right out.</p>

<p>Arter a minit, the Queen begun to larf too, and she sartinly
was about the sweetest lookin critter that I ever did see, with
her purty mouth opening like a red rose-bud, and her leetle
white teeth a shining inside.</p>

<p>"Before I take your medicine," sez she, "tell me what tribe
you belong to?"</p>

<p>I didn't know what on arth to say, for I never could twist my
jaws with one of them crooked Injun names&mdash;but, sez I to
myself, I calculate that a queen aint nothing but a woman arter
all, and it'll only make her think the more of me if I keep dark,
so I shook my head as if there was a good deal in it, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, marm, that's telling. You aint the first gal that has
tried to find me out; but it's plaguey hard work a kneeling down
here, so if you'd jest as livs I'll stand up&mdash;but I raly wish you'd
let that leetle shaver of your'n tend my woodchuck awhile&mdash;I'm
eenamost tuckered out a carrying it."</p>

<p>Here the other Queens and all the Kings and Nights come a
crowding round us all in a twitter to hear what we were so
chipper about. I begun to feel a sort of streaked with so many
of them lofty foreign cattle a looking at me, so I put out my
elbow, and sez I to the Queen&mdash;sez I,</p>

<p>"Will you take my arm and let's go and see if we can't find a
bite of something to eat&mdash;I'm a gittin kinder hungry, aint
you?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141] </a></span></p>
<p>She seemed to hang back a minit as if she was loth to go, but
they all begun to giggle and said they'd go along, so she put her
leetle white hand on my arm, and away we went, the eend of
her frock a streaming out behind, and the leetle chap a holding
on as you've seen a kitten to an old cat's tail.</p>

<p>"Wal," think sez I, "if marm could see me now a streaking
up these ere stairs with a ginuine Queen on one arm and a
stuffed woodchuck under t'other, and a hull grist of Kings and
Queens coming arter us, it seemed to me that she'd allow that
I'd been lifted up a notch or two above the vulgar since I left
hum."</p>

<p>In all my born days I never saw a table that could hold a candle
to the one we found all set off in one of the big rooms up
stairs. There was no eend to the silver and glasses a glitterin
and flashin up among the eatables and drinkables. The visiters
couldn't git to but one side of the table, and on t'other side was
a hull grist of waiters and niggers a bustling about like a swarm
of black wasps in a tantrum.</p>

<p>I gin the Queen a heap of good things, and it raly did me good
to see how she nibbled at 'em; the way she stowed away the
jellies and presarves was as much like any of our York gals as
if she hadn't been a Queen.</p>

<p>When she'd eat about enough I crooked my elbow, and we
went down stairs jest as we cum up&mdash;Kings and Queens and
Nights and Injuns and all&mdash;a rale mixed up squad. As soon as
I'd found a seat for the queen I cut stick as stiff as could be. At
fust I was a going to make her a bow before I went away, but I
wasn't exactly sartin whether Injuns ever larn them things, so I
pulled in and cut away to the big ball room tickled eenamost to
death with the notice that had been taken of me.</p>

<p>I was a looking round arter Cousin Mary, when a leetle slim
stuck up critter cum up to me with her yaller hair all a flying
and her wings spread like a frightened butterfly, and afore I
thought what I was at, I bust right out.</p>

<p>"Good gracious," sez I, "If it aint my etarnal pussey cousin's
leetle finefied darter Jemima!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142] </a></span></p>
<p>The critter heard me and run up and spoke to a fat old Turk
of a feller in a frock and trousers and with a red hankercher
twisted round his head. He got up and whispered to a pussey
sort of a woman all kivered over with yaller silk and glistening
like a bank of ice with gold and stuns, and up they all three
cum a fluttering like a flock of hens at seeing a handful of corn,
and the woman she stuck out her fat hands and squealed out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, cousin Slick, is that you? I declare I'm delighted that
Jemima has found you out. How very bright of her wasn't
it? but then she is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I didn't hear any more, for the foreign quality turned round
and stared with all the eyes they had in their heads. I cut and
run&mdash;pulled foot like scared sheep, till I got outside the door.
For there, as sure as a gun, was my pussy cousin and his wife
turned Turks. It was bad enough to have him a struttin round
to show a feller off, in his black coat and trousers; but I raly
believe I should a gin up if he'd a cum up in his Turk's frock
and great wide silk trousers to claim relationship with me.</p>

<p>My heart riz up in my throat at the idee of going back tu join
the stuck up varmints, and it was a good while before I could
make up mind to skulk back and look up Cousin Beebe and
Mary. She was a dancing with the humped-backed King, and
John was a shinnin it down like all natur with a purty woman,
that wore a shiney black velvet dress, all kivered over with
silver stars. It raly did me good to see him take the double
shuffle; but I was allfired anxious to git away, for fear of seeing
them pussy Turks agin, that he choked off, and we went hum
about as well tuckered out as ever you see three critters.</p>

<p>Arter all I don't think these ere foreigners are anything to
speak on more genteel than our ginuine Americans. Mebby it's
because they hain't got used tu our ways yet, but some on 'em
seemed tu be rather awk'ard in their blazin fine dresses, but I
s'pose it made 'em feel bad tu see how kinder easy we free born
Americans felt with them.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Advice to Jonathan from the Humstead&mdash;Jonathan's criticism on his
Brother Sam's book&mdash;The ennui of Jonathan in good society&mdash;Jonathan's
entree into a Milliner's Establishment, and sad mistake
about a Side-saddle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>It raly makes me feel bad to have you keep a writin so much
advice to me. I du want to please you; and I don't think there
ever is a time in the world when a chap can know enough to
turn up his nose at his father's advice; but it's my ginuine
opinion, that when you let a feller go away from hum, it's best
to let him cut his own fodder.</p>

<p>You've gin me a first rate edecation for your parts, and you've
also told me to be honest and industrious, but sharp as a razor.
The truth is, you've sort of cultivated me, as you du our onion
patches, but arter you've dug them up and put the seed in, and
kept the weeds out till the ginuine roots get stuck purty deep
and the tops shoot up kinder thrifty, haint you also found it to
du best to leave 'em grow accordin to natur, with nothing but
the night dew and rich arth and the warm sunshine to help 'em
along; and don't they git ripe and run up to seed and down to
root, and bring in the hard chink jest as well as if you kept diggin
about 'em and trimmin 'em up from morning till night? If
you keep the weeds out when they're young, and manure the
arth well in the spring, there haint so much danger that the soil
will grow barren all tu once, or that the weeds can spring up so
quick as to choke a good tough onion. It ain't in natur, ask our
minister if it is.</p>

<p>Now don't you be scared about me, if I du go to the theatre
once in a while, or dress up like a darned coot of an Injun jest
to see what etarnal ninny-hammers kings and queens and
quality can make of themselves. I ain't in no danger, I can tell
you. A feller that's got his eye teeth in his head can al'ers see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144] </a></span>enough to larf at in his sleeve, and to make him pity human
natur without forgitting that he's a man, and that he was born
to du good, and not spend his hull life in trying to cut a dash.
Don't you nor marm worry about me&mdash;I may be a leetle green
at fust, but I shall come out right side up with care, yit, you
may be sartin on it.</p>

<p>I feel sort of wamblecropped to day, par, for I've jest been a
reading our Sam's new book about the Great Western. I was
up to cousin Beebe's when he brought it hum, and begun to read
it to Mary. He hadn't read more than twenty pages afore
cousin Mary made believe a headache, as women always du
when they feel oneasy about anything, and she cut and run with
about the reddest face I ever did see. I felt as streaked as a winter
apple, and cousin John, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jonathan, if the folks off in Canada hadn't made Sam a judge,
I'd stick to it that he wasn't a relation of mine; his book raly
ain't fit to read afore the wimmen folks."</p>

<p>I wanted to stick up for Sam, but I'll be darn'd if I could see
how to du it, for the book's an allfired smutty thing, and that's
the fact; but I thought what consarned rough words the printers
sometimes put in my letters to you, when I've writ something
very different,&mdash;and so, think sez I, I'll put it off onto the
printers and publishers; for I'll be choked if I don't believe
they've made as much of a mistake in publishing the book as
Sam did in writing it. So sez I,</p>

<p>"Sam's fust book was a peeler, and a credit to the family;
and I haint the least doubt that this one would been jest as good,
if Sam hadn't strained to beat t'other, and so broke his bridle.
The ginuine grit aint all sifted out on 'm, I'll bet a cookey; and
I haint the least doubt that the printers spiled this one. They're
etarnally twistifying my words into some darn'd thing or other
that would make a minister swear. Sometimes they transmogrify
what I write till I shouldn't know as it was mine; but
then you know, cousin John, it aint everybody that knows how
tu spell out the ginuine English as we du in Weathersfield."
Cousin John he smiled, and then I kept on, and sez I,</p>

<p>"It raly made me grit my teeth to read sich things, and think
the purty gals would believe that I writ them. I didn't blame
my par," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145] </a></span>sez I, "for writing me a great long letter of admonition
about sich words; but he ought to have known better than to
believe I put them there. It aint in my natur to write anything
that the most mealy-mouthed gal on arth mightn't read out loud
afore all the chaps in creation; and if any on 'em see anything
that don't come right up to the chalk, in the way of gentility,
they may be sartin it aint <em>mine</em>."</p>

<p>My dear par, jest you keep easy about me,&mdash;and if you and
marm want to jaw any body, haul our Sam over the coals and
sarmonize him; you'll find fust rate picking on that goose,&mdash;but
I haint but jest begun to put out my pin feathers yit.</p>

<p>Wal now, I may as well give you a leetle notion of my goings-on
here, since I went to that smashing ball, and eat presarves
with a rale queen. Somehow I've begun to git sort of tired of
the big bugs and the tippies, they're all too much alike, and arter
a chap's been to a few of their parties, and balls, and so on, he
kinder loathes their darned soft finefied nonsense, as well as the
cider and sweet sarse that they stuff a feller with.</p>

<p>Going among quality is like boarding at a fust rate tavern.
At fust a critter don't know what to du with himself he's so
tickled with the nice things on the table, but by-and-by his stomach
begins to turn agin the chickens, and turkeys, and young
pigs, and takes tu a hankering arter pot-luck and plain pork and
beans.</p>

<p>This sort of feeling kinder settled on me arter the ball. I raly
was eenamost sot agin the harnsome critters that sidle up and
down Broadway, with leetle round things, made out of silk, about
as big as a good sized toad-stool, stuck up before their faces, to
keep the sun off; so I eenamost made up my mind to put on the
old pepper and salts agin, see a leetle of human natur among
the gals that git their own living, and work themselves to death
to make them stuck up critters in Broadway look as harnsome
as they du.</p>

<p>I'd heard say that there were lots of purty gals to work in the
milliners' stores up in Division street, and in the Bowery, but
somehow I didn't exactly know how to git acquainted with any
on 'em. I never felt a mite bashful about scraping acquaintance
with stuck up critters, like my pussey cousin's wife and Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146] </a></span>Miles; but when I see a harnsome innocent young gal a going
out arly in the morning and a coming home late at night, and
working like a dog to arn a decent living, somehow my heart
rises up in my throat, and insted of shinning up to 'em, and talking
soft sodder, as I du to the tippies, I feel sort of dashed, and as
if a chap ought to take off his hat, and let them see that honest
men respect them the more because they are alone, with nobody
to take care of them.</p>

<p>I never see one of hem harnsome young critters going along
hum, arter working hard all day, to arn something to live on,
and mebby to feed their pars and mars with, but I git to thinkin
how much a ginuine chap ought to prize them for keeping honest,
and industrious, and vartuous, when they haint much to encourage
them to du right, and generally have a good deal to tempt
them to du wrong, insted of turning up their noses at 'em afore
folks, or a tryin to tempt them into sin and wickedness behind
people's backs. It has raly made my blood bile more than ever
to see foreign and dandefied chaps, like that hairy lipped Count,
go by them gals in the day time, with their noses up in the air,
and a looking as if the purty critters warn't good enough to go
along the same stun walk with them, and the stuck up quality
ladies; when any body that took pains to watch the etarnal varments
arter dark, might ketch them a hanging round the dark
corners of the streets, and a chasing arter them same working
gals like so many darn'd yaller foxes scouting round a hen coop,
arter the geese and turkeys; chaps that would run a man through
with a sword-cane or a bagonet if he dared to look sideways at
his wife or sister, will impose on an honest gal if they can git a
chance, and think it's allfired good fun tu. Darn such fellers!
hangin's too good for 'em! I tell you what, par, you may talk
about people's being born free and equal, and about liberty, and
independence, and all that, but it's my opinion that there aint a
place on arth, where the people try to stomp each other down to
the dirt more than they du here in York.</p>

<p>Wal, I wont finish off this ere sarmon, so your minister needn't
get wamblecropped, for fear I'll cut him out. But I'll jest tell
you what put all these sober notions into my head.</p>

<p>You haint forgot that Judy White had a cousin that come here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147] </a></span>to York to larn a trade. She was a tarnal sweet purty critter
when she come away from Weathersfield, as plump as a partridge,
and with cheeks as red as a rosy. Judy made me promise
a good while ago that if ever I come down to York I'd go
and see her cousin, but somehow it does make a feller forget old
friends to be always going to parties and dinners with these big
bugs, and it warn't till t'other day that I thought anything about
Susan Reed.</p>

<p>The fust minit she come into my head I up and went straight
along the Bowery, detarmined to find the place that she worked
at, and see how she was getting along. I had forgot the number,
but when I come to a store that was all windows in front, and
that had a smasher of a bonnet hung agin every square of glass,
besides beautiful caps and ribbons and posies as nat'ral as life,
hung up between, I made up my mind that I'd hit the right nail
on the head, and so in I went as independent as a wood-sawyer's
clerk.</p>

<p>A leetle bit of a stuck up old maid stood back of a counter, all
sot off with bonnets and feathers that looked tempting enough
to make a feller's purse jump right out of his trousers' pocket.
She had on a cap all bowed off with pink ribbons, that looked
queer enough round her leetle wizzled up face, and a calico frock,
figgered out with great bright posies, besides one of them ere
sort of collars round her neck, all sprigged and ruffled off as slick
as a new pin. Her waist warn't bigger round than a quart cup,
and she stuck her hands down in the pockets of her dashy silk
apron, as nat'ral as I could a done it myself. I was jest a
going to ask if Susan Reed worked there, when a lady come in
and wanted to buy a bonnet. At it they went, hand over first,
a bargainin and a tryin on red and yaller and pink and blue bonnets.</p>

<p>The milliner she put one sort on, and then another, and went
on pouring out a stream of soft sodder, while the lady peaked at
herself in a looking-glass, and twistified her head about like a
bird on a bramble bush, and at last said, she didn't know, she'd
look a leetle further, mebby she'd call agin, if she didn't suit
herself, and a heap more palavar, that made the leetle woman
look as if she'd been a drinking a mug of hard cider.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148] </a></span></p>
<p>While the lady was trying to edge off to the door, and the
milliner was a follering her with a blue bonnet, and a great long
white feather a streaming in her hand, I jest took a slantindicular
squint at the glass boxes that stood about chuck full of jimcracks
and furbelows, for there was something in one of 'em that
raly looked curious. It was a sort of a thing stuffed out and
quilted over till it stood up in the glass box as stiff and parpendicular
as a baby's go-cart.</p>

<p>I jest put my hands down in my pockets sort of puzzled, and
stood a looking at the critter to see what I could make on it.
Arter I'd took a good squint at the consarn, up one side, down
t'other, and down the middle, right and left, I purty much made
up my mind that it was one of them new-fashioned side-saddles,
that I'd heard tell on, and I took a notion into my head that I'd
buy one and send it to marm. So when the leetle old maid cum
back from the door, I jest pinted at the saddle, and sez I,</p>

<p>"What's the charge for that are thing?"</p>

<p>"Why, that pair," sez she, a sticking her head on one side, and
a burying her hands, that looked like a hawk's claws, down in the
pocket of her cunning short apron, "I'll put them to you at
twelve dollars; they're French-made, 'lastic shoulder straps,
stitched beautifully in the front, chuck full of whalebone&mdash;and
they set to the shape like the skin to a bird."</p>

<p>Lord a massey, how the little stuck up critter did set off the
talk! I couldn't shove in a word edgeways, till she stopped
to git breath, and then sez I,</p>

<p>"I s'pose you throw in the martingales, sirsingle, and so on,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"The what," says she, a stepping back, and squinting up in my
face sort of cross, as if she didn't like to throw in the whole
harnessing at that price.</p>

<p>"The martingale," sez I, "and the sirsingle; but mebby you
have some other name for 'em down here in York. I mean the
straps that come down in front to throw the chest out, and give
the neck a harnsome bend, and the thing to girt up in the
middle with. Marm wont know how to use this new-fashioned
thing if I don't send all the tackle with it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149] </a></span></p>
<p>"Oh," sez the milliner, "I didn't understand; you want the
laces and the steel in front; sartinly we give them in. The steel
is kivered with kid, and the laces are of the strongest silk."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I never heard of a steel martingale, and I should
be afeard they wouldn't be over pliable."</p>

<p>"Oh," sez she, "you can bend 'em double, they give so."</p>

<p>"How you talk," says I, "it raly is curious what new inventions
people du have, but somehow it sort of seems to me that a
silk girt might be a leetle too slimpsey, don't you think so
marm?"</p>

<p>"Lor, no sir," sez she, "they are strong enough, I can tell you;
jest take a look at the Broadway ladies, they never use anything
else, and they girt tight enough, I'm sure."</p>

<p>I hadn't the least idee what the critter was a diving at; she
see that I looked sort of puzzled, and I s'pose she begun to
think that I shouldn't buy the saddle.</p>

<p>"Look a here," sez she, a putting her hands on both sides of her
leetle stuck up waist; "I've got 'em on myself, so you can judge
how tight they can be fitted."</p>

<p>"Gaully offalus!" sez I, a snorting out a larfing, and a eyeing
the leetle finefied old maid; but I didn't think it was very good
manners to burst right out so, and I tried all I could to choke in.
Gracious me! think sez I, no wonder the York gals have such
humps on their backs, since they've got to wearing saddles like
horses.</p>

<p>By-am-by, arter I'd eenamost bust myself a trying to stop larfing,
it come into my head that the critter of a milliner was a trying
to poke fun at me, cause I wanted to beat her down: for I
couldn't believe the tippies quite so bad as to girt up and strap
down like a four year old colt. Wal, think sez I, I'll be up to
her anyhow; so I looked jest as mealy-mouthed as if I believed
her, and sez I, as innocent as a rabbit in a box trap, sez I,</p>

<p>"If the wimmen folks have took to wearing saddles, I s'pose
they haint forgot the bridles tu; so I dont care if I take this
ere pair for some old maids we've got in our parts. If I had my
way, they'd all be bitted the minit they turned the fust corner.
Darn'd talking critters them old maids are, marm," sez I, a looking
at her sort of slanting, jest to let her see she hadn't got hold
of quite so great a greenhorn as she seemed to think.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150] </a></span></p>
<p>Lord a Massey, how she did look! Her leetle wizzled up
face begun to twist itself up till it looked like a red winter apple
puckered up by the frost. I didn't seem to mind it, but put my
hand down in my pocket sort of easy, and begun to whistle
Yankee Doodle.</p>

<p>"You haint got no bridle's then?" sez I, after a minit; for she
looked wrathy enough to spit fire, and sot up sich an opposition
in the pocket line, that I was raly afeard her leetle hands would
bust through the silk or break her apron strings, she dug down
so.</p>

<p>"Bridles! no!" sez she, as spiteful as a meat-axe jest ground,
"but I'll send out and git a halter for you, with all my heart."</p>

<p>"Gaully!" sez I, "but you're clear grit&mdash;smart as a steel trap,
aint you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sez she, more spiteful yet, "when it snaps at some
animal like you, that don't know enough to keep out of its teeth?"</p>

<p>Think sez I, Mr. Jonathan Slick, Esq., it's about time for you
to haul in these horns of your'n. You aint no match for a
woman, anyhow; there never was a critter of the feminine
gender, that couldn't talk a chap out of his seven senses in less
than no time.</p>

<p>"Gaully," sez I, "you've about used me up&mdash;I begin to feel
streaked as lean pork in the bottom of a barrel. I guess I shan't
tackle in with a smart critter like you agin in a hurry! but don't
git too mad; it'll spile that harnsome face of your'n. I swan!
but I should think you was eenamost thirty this minit, if I hadn't
seen the difference before you begun to rile up."</p>

<p>Didn't the puckers go out of her face when I said this! She
was mollified down in a minit. I don't s'pose she ever had twenty
years took off from her good fifty so slick afore in her hull life;
but it aint human natur to come out all to once,&mdash;at any rate, it
aint an old maid's natur, when her back once gits up. So when
I see her darned thin lips begin to pucker and twist into sort of
a smile, I let off a leetle more soft sodder, that wilted her down
like a cabbage-leaf in the sun; and then sez I, a pinting to the
glass-box&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, now, s'posing we strike up a trade. I've took a sort
of a sneaking notion to that ere new-fashioned side-saddle. So
if you'll throw in the tackling, I'll give you ten dollars for it,
cash on the nail."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151] </a></span></p>
<p>"That what?" said she, a looking fust at me and then at the
saddle, with her mouth a leetle open and her eyes sticking out
like peeled onions. "That what?"</p>

<p>"Why, that are saddle," sez I, beginning to feel my dander
rise.</p>

<p>"That saddle," sez she, "that saddle; why, sir, did you take
that pair of French corsets for a saddle?"</p>

<p>With that she slumped down into a chair, and kivered her face
with both hands, and larfed till I raly thought the critter would a
split her sides. The way she wriggled back'rd and fored, tee-heeing
and haw-hawing, was enough to make a Presbyterian
Missionary swear like a sea captain.</p>

<p>"That saddle!" sez she, a looking up from between her hands,
and then letting off the fun again as bad as ever. "That saddle!
<em>Oh, dear, I shall die.</em> Did you really take that pair of <em>French
corsets</em> for a side-saddle, sir? Oh, dear, I shall die a larfin!"</p>

<p>Didn't I feel streaked though! Only think what an etarnal
coot I had made of myself, to take a pair of gal's corsets for a
side-saddle. "Darn the things," sez I, and it was as much as I
could du to keep from putting foot to the glass case, and kicking
it into the street. I felt the blood bile up into my face, and
when the old maid bust out agin, and I see a hull grist of purty
faces come a swarming to a glass door, that they'd hauled back
a curtain from, I could have skulked through a knot hole, I felt
so dreadful mean. But by-am-by I begun to think they had more
cause to be ashamed than I had. Who on arth would ever have
thought them stiff indecent looking things were made for a delicate
gal to wear? I felt dreadfully though, to think that I'd
been a talking about a gal's under-riggin, to a woman so long,
but after a few minits I begun to think that I needn't fret myself
much about that. The woman that stuck them things out in the
street for young fellers to look at, needn't go off in a fit of "the
dreadful suz," because a chap asks the price of them. "So, who
cares!" sez I.</p>

<p>The old maid jumped up, arter she'd larfed herself into a
caniption fit, and out on it agin&mdash;and she run into the back room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152] </a></span>where the gals were. It warn't more than a minit before there
was in there sich a pow-wow and rumpus kicked up,&mdash;the gals
begun to hop about like parched corn on a hot shovel. They
sot up sich a giggle and tee-heeing, that I couldn't a stood it one
minit longer. But all tu once I heard somebody say,</p>

<p>"My gracious, it's Mr. Jonathan Slick, from our parts!"</p>

<p>At that they all choked in, and were as still as mice in a flour
bin. I looked to the glass door, and there stood Susan Reed, a
holding back the curtain with one hand and peaking through a
square of glass to be sartin it was me. I tell you what, but the
gal looked like a picter, and a darned purty picter tu, as she
stood a holding back the heap of red cloth in her dark colored
calico dress, and black silk apron that made her neck and
face look as white as a lily. The rosy cheeks that she used to
have in Weathersfield were all gone, and her eyes seemed as if
they'd grown larger than they ever were before. I don't know
when I've seen a gal that has took my notion as she did while
she was a standing in that door. Arter a minit I see her fling
her head back till the long shiney curls streamed in heaps over
her shoulder, and I heard her say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, let me go out!&mdash;I'm sure it's him."</p>

<p>"What of that?" I heard the old maid squeak out, as sour as
vinegar; "he aint no relation, is he?"</p>

<p>"No, no," sez Susan, a droppin the curtain, and a speaking as
if her heart was brim full and a running over; "but he come
from Weathersfield,&mdash;we went to school together; he come from
<em>home</em>,&mdash;I must speak to him!"</p>

<p>With that she opened the door and come towards me, a holding
out her hand and a trying to smile; but the tears were a
standing in her great blue eyes, and I raly thought she was a
going to bust right out a crying. I knew she was a thinking
about the old humstead, and when I remembered how them
darned lawyers cheated her old mother out of house and hum,
I felt so bad I could a cried tu, jest as well as not.</p>

<p>I went right up and shook hands, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you du, Susan? I swanny! but the sight of you is
good for sore eyes; it raly seems like old times, only jest to look
at you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153] </a></span></p>
<p>She kinder smiled a leetle, and sez she, "How are all the folks
in Weathersfield?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they were all so as to be crawling about when I come
away," sez I. "Sally Sikes has got married, I s'pose you
know."</p>

<p>"And how is cousin Judy?" sez she.</p>

<p>"Purty well, considerin," sez I; and you can't think how all-overish
I felt to hear any body speak of Judy so fur from hum.
I was jest a going to say something to keep her from asking anything
more about the gal, when the old maid she come out, and
sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Reed, I don't hire you to talk with young fellers in the
front shop."</p>

<p>Gaully! didn't my blood bile, I could a knocked the stuck up
leetle varmint into a cocked hat, but Susan she looked sort of
scared, and, sez she,</p>

<p>"Call and see me, Mr. Slick, at my boarding-house: I shall be
<em>so</em> glad to talk over old times." The tears bust right into her
blue eyes as she spoke, and she looked so humsick I raly felt for
her.</p>

<p>"What time shall I call?" sez I, a follering her to the glass
door.</p>

<p>"I haint a minit that I can call my own till arter eight o'clock
at night," sez she; "but if you'll call some evening I shall be
glad to see you."</p>

<p>"I shall sartinly come," sez I, and arter shaking hands with her
agin I went out of the store and hum to my office, a feeling purty
considerably humsick and with more ginuine human natur bilin
up in my heart than I'd felt since I cum to York.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan visits the Milliner girl&mdash;Reflections about her situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>I couldn't seem to rest easy till I went to see Susan. She
boarded in a sort of a gloomy house eenamost up to Dry-dock.
I knocked away at the door with my knuckles ever so long afore
I could make any body hear. By-am-by Susan come to the door
herself, and she took me up a pair of stairs, kivered with rag carpeting,
into a leetle stived up room with a stove in it. Two
leetle squalling brats were a playing on the floor, and a harnsome
woman, but not over nice in her fixings, sot in one corner, a
sewing on a round-about. Susan she was dressed up jest as she
was in the milliner's store; she looked peaked and eenamost
tuckered out, but the minit I'd got seated, she took hold with the
woman and begun to sew away for dear life.</p>

<p>"You seem to be rather industrious," sez I.</p>

<p>She smiled sort of mournful, and sez she, so low I couldn't but
jest ketch the words,</p>

<p>"I'm obliged to be or starve."</p>

<p>Think sez I, there's something that aint right here, and with
that I begun to talk about the prices of the work, till I found
out that with all her hard trying, it was more than she could du
to arn a decent living. I begun to talk about hum and the time
when I used to lend her my mittens when she was a leetle gal and
her fingers were cold; but all I could do she wouldn't chirk up,
but the other woman she got rale sociable and told me lots of
stories about milliners and sewing girls, and as I was going hum
I took it into my head that I'd write some on 'em out for the
Express.</p>

<p>I mean to send one on 'em next week, but I raly think they
ought to shell out more chink than they du for my letters, for
I've had to study the dictionary two days a ready to sarch out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155] </a></span>long words, and I haint got half enough yit. I went to Cousin
Beebe about it, and he said that mebby I'd better study some of
the arly English writers before I begun to write stories, or else
Washington Irving, Cooper, or some of them chaps might cut
me out. I didn't jest know what he meant by arly writers, but
made up my mind that it was them that begun to write when they
was shavers, so I went into a bookstore and told them I wanted
to buy a good book that was writ by some English youngster.</p>

<p>"Here's a work by Boz," say he, a handing down a big book;
"he begun the youngest and writes the best of any of the folks
across the water." I bought the book and went back to my office.
Gaully-oppalus, but aint that Boz Dickens a smasher! if
he don't beat all natur, nobody does. If I could write like him I
raly should bust my dandy vest, I should be so puffed up. I kept
on reading eenamost all night, and more than once I bust right
out a crying afore I knew it. I swan to man that leetle Nell
that he writes about is the sweetest, purtyest critter that anybody
ever dreamed on. Oh! how I wish you would read the
story about her, it's as good as the Pilgrim's Progress any day.</p>

<p>Then there's a mean, etarnal sneaking coot, a Mr. Quilp, that
drunk bilin hot licker out of a skillet, and licked a poor peaked
little critter&mdash;his wife&mdash;amost to death every once in a while,
and when he hadn't her handy he took to cudgelling a wooden
image. I swan to man, it made my blood bile to read about sich
dreadful carryings on; but yit when I cum to consider and think
on it all over, it kinder seems to me as if Boz Dickens had stretched
his galluses a trifle, in writing out sich an allfired spiteful varmint.
Human natur is bad enough, any how; but my paper is
run out, and I aint but jest room to subscribe myself.</p>

<p>MISS JOSEPHINE BURGESS&mdash;A TALE.</p>

<p class="chaphead">In which Jonathan shows up the Hardships of Sewing Girls&mdash;Describes
a Tammany Hall Ball&mdash;Milliner Aristocracy and Exclusiveness&mdash;Informs
the reader how Miss Josephine Burgess took a tall
man with whiskers into her Establishment, who took her in in return&mdash;The
desperation of a little Apothecary&mdash;His Marriage, and
the Ascent of Miss Josephine Burgess from the front store to a
work room a little higher up.</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess was as purty a gal as ever trod shoe
leather; but she was awfully stuck up, and got into all kind of
finefied notions, arter her par, the old shoemaker, died and left
her his arnings. She was an awful smart critter though, and
had a sort of a notion which side her bread was buttered on,
as well as anybody you ever sot eyes on. Instid of spending the
seven hundred dollars, which the stingy old coot of a shoemaker
left behind him, all in hard chink, she sot up a milliner's and
dress-maker's store in the Bowery; and it raly would have done
the old chap's ghost good, to have seen how she contrived to
turn the sixpences and half dollars that he'd been hoarding up
so long in an old pepper-and-salt stocking, for fear of losing 'em.
A tarnal snug bisness Miss Josephine Burgess was a doing, I can
tell you. If she didn't know how to make things gibe, there
wasn't a gal in the Bowery that did, you may be sartin. She
raly had a talent for the bisness&mdash;a sort of genius in the bonnet
way. With her own harnsome leetle fingers she cut and snipped
and twisted and pinned on the shiney stuff and ribbons to all the
caps and bonnets turned off by the ten peeked looking thin
young girls that worked twelve hours out of every twenty-four, in
a garret bed-room, in the back of the house, where Miss Josephine
Burgess kept her store. Her thin peeked looking young
girls might have enjoyed themselves if they only had a mind to!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157] </a></span>There never was such a prospect as they had to look upon when
they got tired. If they jest turned their bright eyes up to get a
peek at the sky, there was a hull regiment of chimnies, all a
sending out smoke like a company of Florida sogers; and if they
looked down, there were ever so many backyards cut up into
sort of pig pens, with lots of bleech boxes a pouring out the
brimstone smoke, and old straw bonnets strung out to dry, that
made every thing look comfortable and like live. Miss Josephine
Burgess was a purty good boss considerin. She let her
gals have half an hour to eat their dinners in, and if any on 'em
didn't happen to get to the shop at seven o'clock in the morning
she never docked off more than half their day's wages. She
was rather apt to get out of temper once in a while; but then
insted of blowing the gals up, as some cross grained critters will,
she only blew up their work, and made them du it all over agin;
which was a more easy way of spitting out spite, and putting a
few coppers into her own pocket; for when it took half of a day to
du the work, and another half to alter it, she only made the
poor gals lose a half day's wages; and if they didn't like that
she'd al'rs give them leave to get a better place; which, considering
that half the sewin gals in York are always out of work,
was raly very good natured and considerate in her. Besides this
she had a good many ginerous leetle ways of turning a copper.
When the peeked, haggard young critters came down from the
work-room, at twelve o'clock Saturday night&mdash;for Miss Josephine
Burgess was awful pious, it wasn't only once in a great
while that she made the gals work over into the Sabberday
morning&mdash;as she paid them their wages Miss Josephine always
found out that some mistake had been made in the work&mdash;a piece
of silk cut into, or a bit of leghorn burnt brown in the bleaching,
which melted down the twenty shillings which they ought to
have had apiece, to eighteen, or mebby two dollars; all of which
must sartinly have been to the satisfaction and amusement of
the pale troop of gals, who had two dollars to pay for board, besides
clothes and washing to get along with, out of the twenty-five
cents that were left; and if they didn't seem to like it, Miss Josephine
wasn't agoing to fret her herself about that. She al'rs
contrived to tucker them out with hard work before she settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158] </a></span>up, so that there was no fear of their saying much agin what she
took of their wages. Sometimes the tears would come into their
eyes; and some on 'em that hadn't no hum to go tu, except the
leetle garret bed-rooms which they were over head and ears in
debt for, would burst out and sob as if they hadn't a friend on
arth; but crying is a good deal like drinking&mdash;it hurts them that
take to it more than it does anybody else. Miss Josephine Burgess
didn't care a copper for tears and sobs; she'd got used to
'em.</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess raly had a talent for her bisness. Nobody
ever learned so many prudent ways of laying up money.
She used to dress up like a queen, and her Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes were the genuine things and genteel all over. Eenamost
every Sabberday she would go to meeting in a branfire new bonnet;
and if some of her good natured customers that staid to
hum because theirs warn't finished, had one just like it come to
the door on Monday morning, the leetle gal that waited for the
band-box only had to say, that she sarched and sarched on Saturday
night and couldn't find the house. It doesn't hurt a
dashing bonnet to wear it eenajest once. Miss Josephine never
kept her customers a waiting over more than one Sunday, only
when they were very busy or paid beforehand. Folks that are
always a minding other people's business used to talk about Miss
Josephine, and call her extravagant and stuck up; but the varmints
didn't know what they were a talking about more than
nothing. If she had her silks and satins made up every month,
the making cost eenamost nothing. The working gals always
expected to sit up till twelve o'clock Saturday nights in hurrying
times; and when it wasn't hurrying time Miss Josephine had
always a frock to finish off for herself or something of that sort.
The frocks answered jest as well to make bonnets out on, arter
she'd dashed out in 'em once or twice, and the sleeves and waist
cut up scrumptiously for ruffles and furbelows.</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess understood the soft sodder principle
like a book. She had a way of bantering off the bonnets and gimcracks
that was raly curious. If a customer happened to take a notion
to having color and shape of a bonnet, she would insist upon it
that she should try it on afore the glass; and while the lady was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159] </a></span>a gittin good natured, and a beginning to feel stuck up with the
looks of herself, Miss Josephine would twist about the bows, and
spread out the ribbands, and tell how very nice it all was, the
face and the bonnet agreed so well. She had jest <em>that</em> face in her
mind when the bonnet was under way&mdash;so delicate&mdash;so graceful&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;<em>very</em>
handsome. Some people hadn't the least notion of
harmony and grace. It raly did her heart good to make things
for a lady who knew which was which. She always kept them
sort of hats for her most fashionable customers. She wouldn't
have them get common for anything&mdash;raly she couldn't tell how
that one got out on the counter; but shop gals were the most
careless critters on arth&mdash;sometimes she did feel as if she couldn't
git along with 'em&mdash;but in them hard times it raly went agin her
heart to turn 'em away, so she got along as well as she could.</p>

<p>Here Miss Josephine Burgess would break sharp off and let the
customer look at herself in the glass, only just throwing in a
word once in a while to help along. Then she'd pull the bonnet
a leetle for'ed, tuck away the lady's curls under it, and stick her
own head a one side to "take an observation;" arter that she'd
kinder put up both hands and say "beautiful!" jest as if the
word bust right out, all she could do to help it. By-am-by Miss
Josephine Burgess would sort of fold her hands over the black
apron, and step back a leetle to give her customer time to twistify
afore the glass, and wonder whether the milliner meant the
bonnet or her face, or both together, when she said "beautiful."
The hull of it eenamost always tarminated by Miss Josephine
Burgess selling the bonnet, and the lady's swimming off chuck
full and brimming over with soft sodder, like a darn'd turkey-gobbler,
stuffed out with Injun meal.</p>

<p>If a customer did <em>not</em> take a notion to the bonnet, or seemed
to hanker arter something else, Miss Josephine had nothing to
do but to alter her tune for another sort of a dancer.</p>

<p>"Folks with homely faces," sez she, "ought to be squeamish
about colors;" in fact they couldn't help it, if they wanted to
look decent; but some folks raly seemed to look harnsome in anything;
it was the face arter all that sot off the bonnet. Some
people had such clear skins that they could bear a bright orange
color, and look purty as a pink arter all. Once in a while Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160] </a></span>Josephine sartinly did overdo the bisness a leetle, but she almost
always made out to trade somehow, without her customer turned
out to be some sly coot of a sister milliner a running round to
hunt up patterns, or some darned critter out a shopping on a
fourpence-ha'penny capital.</p>

<p>Besides tending her shop, and cutting and trimming, and all
that, Miss Josephine Burgess found time to do a leetle courting,
over work, with a finefied sort of a 'pothecary feller that sold doctor
stuff over the way agin her store. But she didn't let this take
up much of her time, nor no sich thing&mdash;she wasn't a gal to let
her heart run away with her head, any how they could fix it.
While the finefied stuck up leetle 'pothecary shut up his shop over
the way, and sot more'n half the time twisting up the thread and
leetle bits of ribbon that Miss Josephine Burgess snipped off with
a pair of sharp pinted scissors, hitched to her side by a black
watch guard, and kept a puckering up his mouth and a talking
darned finefied nonsense, as sweet as the jujube paste, and the
peppermint drops that he brought in his trousers' pocket, she sot
as independent as a cork-screw, with one foot stuck upon a bonnet
block, a twisting up bows, and a sticking pins and feathers
into a heap of silk and millinery stuff. Once in a while she managed
to stick a peppermint drop into her leetle mouth, and to
turn her eyes to the 'pothecary with <em>sich</em> a look, so soft and killing,
it went right straight through his heart, like a pine skewer
through a chunk of butcher's meat.</p>

<p>There was never anything went on so slick as these critters
did, arter they took to hankering arter each other&mdash;it raly was
better than a play to see how they got along. The 'pothecary
chap was a sneezer at figures. He'd cyphered thro' Dayboll's
Arithmetic three times, and could say off the multiplication table
without stopping to catch breath. So he sometimes overhauled
the milliner's books, not because he wanted to know any
thing about them, but 'cause women folks are so apt to be imposed
on. He writ out her leetle bills, and kept a sort of running
notion of her cash accounts, for she warn't much of a judge of
money, and so always sent her bank bills over to his shop to
know whether they were ginuine or not. She did all these leetle
trifles in a delicate genteel sort of a way, that was sartinly very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161] </a></span>gratifying and pleasant to the 'pothecary; he raly begun to fat up
and grow pussy on the strength on't; it wouldn't aben human
natur if he hadn't.</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess was a setting in her back shop a thinking
over the 'pothecary chap, and the dollars and cents she'd
skinned out of the gals' wages that week, a making them work at
half price because the <em>times were so bad</em>, when the 'pothecary
came a tip-toeing through the store looking as tickled as if he'd
found a sixpence. He took two ball tickets out of his vest pocket
and held one on 'em out to the milliner, and stood a bowing
and a grinning like a darned babboon till she read the writin'
on it.</p>

<p>"I raly don't know what to say," sez she, "I never have been
to the Tammany hall, and I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It'll be the top of the notch, this one," sez the chap, "they're
a goin to be awful partickler who they invite&mdash;nothing but the
raly genteel who get tickets, I promise 'em."</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess puckered up her mouth, and said "she
didn't know: she was afeard she might meet with some of the
working classes&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say no&mdash;it'll break my heart, it will sartinly," sez the
lovyer. "Don't drive me to takin pison on your account&mdash;oh
don't."</p>

<p>Miss Josephine kinder started up&mdash;gave a sort of a scream&mdash;and
said she wouldn't drive the 'pothecary to taking pison, and that
she would go the ball. The minit she said that the leetle chap
went right off into a fit of the dreadful suz: he slumped right
down on his marrow bones, and begun to nibble away like all
natur at the four little fingers, that stuck out of Miss Josephine
Burgess's right hand mit.</p>

<p>"Oh, say only jest one thing more, and I shall be so happy, I
shall want to jump out of my skin," sez he, all in a twitteration.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, what do you mean? I swanny, I'm all in a
fluster," sez she.</p>

<p>"Here, down on my knees, I ask, I entreat, I conjure, most
beautiful of wimmen folks," sez he, "that you be my partner,
not only at the ball, but through this ere mortal life, that is a
stretching before us like a great paster lot covered over with tansey,
wild rhubarb and sage roots all in bloom&mdash;don't blush, my
angel, but speak!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162] </a></span></p>
<p>Now Miss Josephine knew as well as could be, that it was the
fashion to feel dreadfully at sich times&mdash;to get up a caniption fit,
or any how to give right up and set kivered all over with blushes;
but the bit of cotton wool that she used always to put on her
blushes with, was tucked away in the top of her stocking, and
she couldn't get at it handy without being seen. So she puckered
up her mouth and looked as if she had just lost her
granny.</p>

<p>"Give me <em>one</em> word of hope, now du," sez the anxious 'pothecary,
a squeezing the milliner's hand, mit and all, between both of
his, and a twisting his head a one side, and a rolling up his eyes,
like a hen that's jest done drinking.</p>

<p>"Oh dear suz, what <em>can</em> I answer?" sez Miss Josephine Burgess,
a wriggling her shoulders and kivering up her face with one
hand, "I never felt so in all my life&mdash;dear me."</p>

<p>"Don't spurn me away from these ere leetle feet&mdash;nobody will
ever love you so agin," sez the anxious chap, and with that he
struck his hand sort of fierce agin his heart, that was floundering
away under his yaller vest like a duck in a mud-puddle.</p>

<p>"Git up&mdash;oh du," sez Miss Josephine, catching a sly peek at
the 'pothecary, through her fingers.</p>

<p>"One word of hope," sez the chap, a giving his bosom another
tarnal dig; "say that you will be mine."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," sez Miss Josephine Burgess, a sighing
through her fingers.</p>

<p>"Say that you will be mine, or I will die on this ere very spot,
and be sent down to posterity a living monument of wimmen's
hard-heartedness," sez the 'pothecary, a running his fingers
through his hair, till it stuck up sort of wild every which way
over his head. "Do you want to make this ere body a morter,
and pound my loving heart to pieces with the pestle of delay?
If not, speak and say that my love is returned."</p>

<p>"It is," said Miss Josephine Burgess, kinder faint from behind
her hand.</p>

<p>"Angelic critter," sez the lovyer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163] </a></span></p>
<p>"Now leave me," sez Miss Josephine Burgess.</p>

<p>"Harnsomest of created wimmen! I will," sez the 'pothecary.</p>

<p>"Oh how my heart beats," sez Miss Josephine Burgess.</p>

<p>"And mine," sez the 'pothecary, a getting up and a spreading
his hand out on his yaller vest.</p>

<p>"Leave me now," sez Miss Josephine Burgess.</p>

<p>"My dear critter, I will," sez the 'pothecary.</p>

<p>With that he made tracks across the street, opened his empty
money drawer with a sort of a chuckle, as much as to say, "if
you're starved out in this way much longer I lose my guess," and
then he drank off a glass of cold water, with a leetle brandy
in it.</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess sat still as a mouse, till the 'pothecary
chap made himself scarce, then she let down her hands and took
a squint in the glass to see how her face stood it. Arter that
she went to a big drawer, where she kept her slickest dry goods,
and cut off a lot of shiney red velvet, which she took up stairs,
and told the gal that had charge of the work-room, to have it
made up into a ball dress before the gals went home. The ten
poor tired young critters were jest a beginning to think about
going hum to supper, but they sot down agin and looked in each
other's faces, as melancholy as could be, but said nothing. The
young gal that had charge of the work-room, happened to say
that in the course of a week they would have a prime lot of red
velvet bonnets to sell. At this Miss Josephine Burgess looked as
cross as if she'd swallowed a paper of darning needles, and told
the young gal to hold her tongue, and mind her own business.
At this the young gal drew up, and was a going to give the milliner
her change back agin, but jest that minit she happened to
think that taking sarce from a stuck up critter was bad enough,
but that starving was a good deal worse; and so she choked in
and went to work at the dress, with her heart a swelling in her
harnsome bosom, like a bird when it's first caught.</p>

<p>"Don't let them gals go to sleep over their work," sez Miss
Josephine Burgess, as she was a going down stairs.</p>

<p>The young gal who had charge of the work-room, said something
sort of loud about people's having no feeling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164] </a></span></p>
<p>"What's that you say?" sez Miss Josephine Burgess, a coming
back as spiteful as could be.</p>

<p>"Nothing," sez the young gal who had charge of the work-room.</p>

<p>"It's well you didn't," sez the milliner, and with that she
went down stairs, and the poor tuckered out young critters didn't
get hum to supper till ten o'clock at night, because they had to
stay and finish off Miss Josephine Burgess's ball finery.</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess was a sitting in the leetle room up
over her store, ready dressed for the ball, when the little apprentice
gal cum up and told her, that the gentleman from over the
way was a waiting down stairs. The milliner jumped up and
began to wriggle about afore the looking glass to be sartin that
the red velvet frock, the golden chain, and the heap of posies
that she'd twistified in her hair, were all according to gunter.
Arter she'd took a purty gineral survey, she went down stairs
about the darndest stuck up critter that you ever sot eyes on.</p>

<p>The 'pothecary stood afore the looking glass a trying to coax
his hair to curl a leetle, and a pulling up fust one side of his
white satin stock and then t'other, to make it set up parpendicular.
He'd got a leetle speck of dirt on his silk stockings and his
shiney dancing pumps, a coming across the street, so he took his
white hankercher out of his pocket and began to dust them off;
but the minit Miss Josephine Burgess cum in he stopped short,
stepped back agin the wall, and held up both hands as if he raly
didn't know what to du with himself, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never did! Talk about the Venus de Medici, or the New
York beauty! Did ever anything come up to that are?"</p>

<p>Arter this bust of feeling, he gin a spring fore'd and ketching
her hand, eenamost eat it up, he kissed so consarned eager. It
didn't seem as if there was any contenting the darn'd love-sick
coot. But when he hung on too hard, the milliner's vartuous indignation
begun to bile up, and so he choked off and begged her
pardon; but said he couldn't help it, as true as the world he
couldn't, his heart was brim full and a running over.</p>

<p>I ruther guess the people stared a few when the leetle 'pothecary
walked along the Tammany ball-room with Miss Josephine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165] </a></span>Burgess, in her red velvet and golden chains, a hanging on his
arm. Sich dashers didn't show themselves at every ball by a
great sight. There was a ginuine touch of the aristocracy in the
way the leetle 'pothecary turned up his nose, and flourished his
white gloves; and when they stood up to dance, Miss Josephine
held out her red velvet, and stuck out her foot, and curcheyed
away as slick as any of the Broadway gals could a done it. But
jest as she was a going to dance, who should stand afore her in
the same reel but the very young gal that took charge of her
work-room. The milliner had jest took a fold of the red velvet
between her thumb and finger, and was flourishing out her foot
to balance up as genteel as could be, but the minit she ketched
sight of the working gal, she gin her head a toss and reaching
out her hand to the 'pothecary, walked off to a seat in a fit of
outraged dignity that was raly beautiful to look at. Arter this
Miss Josephine Burgess said she wouldn't try to dance among
sich low critters; and so she and the 'pothecary sidled about, eat
peppermint drops and talked soft sodder to one another&mdash;alers
taking care to turn up their noses when the harnsome working
gal cum within gun-shot of 'em.</p>

<p>"Who <em>can</em> that gentleman be, that's a eyeing me through his
glass," sez Miss Josephine Burgess to the 'pothecary, "what
harnsome whiskers he's got, did you ever?"</p>

<p>"I don't see anything over genteel in him, any how," sez the
'pothecary a looking sort of oneasy. "I really can't see how
you ladies can take a fancy to so much hair."</p>

<p>"But how nicely he's dressed," sez she.</p>

<p>"I aint over fond of shaggy vests and checkered trousers,"
says the 'pothecary.</p>

<p>"Dear me he's coming this way," sez the milliner all in a twitter,&mdash;"I
hope he wont think of speaking."</p>

<p>"I hope so too," sez the 'pothecary, a looking as if he'd jest
eat a sour lemon, without any sweetening.</p>

<p>The chap come along sort of easy and independent, and stood
close by 'em.</p>

<p>"Shan't we go t'other end of the room?" sez the 'pothecary
to the milliner, kinder half whispering, and a eyeing the strange
chap as savage as a meat-ax. "Not yet," sez the milliner, giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166] </a></span>a slantindicular sort of a look at the strange chap. He wasn't
a feller to be sneezed at in the way of good looks any how, nor
a man that was likely to lose anything by his bashfulness; for it
warn't more than three minutes afore he asked the milliner to
dance, and walked her out as crank as could be, right afore the
'pothecary's face. Didn't the poor leetle chap look wamble-cropped
when he see that. There he stood all alone in a corner,
feeling as sick as if he'd swallowed a dose of his own doctor's
stuff, and there he had to stand; for arter the tall chap and Miss
Josephine Burgess had got through dancing, they sot down together
by a winder and begun to look soft sodder at one another,
and talk away as chipper as two birds on an apple tree limb in
spring time. It didn't do no good for the 'pothecary to rile up
and make motions to her&mdash;she didn't seem to mind him a bit; so
he stood still and grit his teeth, for it seemed to him as if the
milliner and the red velvet, besides the account books, the stock
in trade, and the hard chink too, was a sliding out of his grip
like a wet eel.</p>

<p>"Darn the feller to darnation," sez he, arter he'd bore it as
long as he could&mdash;and with that he went up to Miss Josephine
Burgess, sort of humble, and asked her if it wasn't about time
to be a going hum?</p>

<p>The milliner said she wasn't in any hurry about it, and went
to talking with the tall chap agin. It was as much as the poor
lovyer could do to keep from busting out a crying, or a swearing,
he warn't partic'lar which; he felt all struck up of a heap,
and went off to his corner agin as lonesome as a goose without
a mate.</p>

<p>By-am-by the milliner she come up and told him she was
about ready to go hum; the tall chap he went down stairs with
them, and stood a kissing his hand to her till she got into the
street. The 'pothecary raly felt as if he should bust, and he gin
her a purty decent blowing up as they went along Chatham-street.
She didn't give him much of an answer though, for her
head was chuck full of the tall chap's soft sodder, and she didn't
know more than half of what he was a jawing about.</p>

<p>The leetle 'pothecary went hum and hurried up to bed, but all
he could du he couldn't get a wink of sleep. He got up arly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167] </a></span>the morning, but he hadn't no appetite for his breakfast, and
kinder hung about his shop door a keeping a good look out to see
if anybody went to the milliner's, and a wondering if it was best
for him to go over and see how she seemed to be arter what he'd
said to her the night afore. So he brushed up his hair and was
just taking his hat to go over and try his luck, when a harnsome
green buggy waggon hauled up jest agin the milliner's, and out
jumped the tall chap with the whiskers.</p>

<p>The 'pothecary he turned as white as a sheet and begun to
cuss and swear like all natur. He had plenty of time to let his
wrathy feelings bile over, for it was more than three hours afore
the green buggy waggon driv away agin. The minit it was out
of sight, the 'pothecary snatched up his hat and scooted across
the street like a crazy critter. Miss Burgess was a sitting in her
leetle back room dressed out like anything. This made him
more wrathy than he was afore, for she never dressed out when
he was a coming, so he went straight up to her, and sez he, sort
of wrathy,</p>

<p>"Miss Josephine Burgess, what am I to think of this ere treatment?"</p>

<p>The milliner looked up as innocent as a kitten, as if she hadn't
the least idee what he meant.</p>

<p>"What treatment?" sez she, as mealy-mouthed as could be.</p>

<p>The 'pothecary felt as if he should choke; he griped his hand,
and the words came out of his mouth like hot bullets.</p>

<p>"Oh you perfidious critter, you," sez he, "how can you look
in my face arter you've been a sitting three hull hours with that
darn'd nasty tall coot that you danced with all the time last
night."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know what you mean more than nothing. I
danced with a gentleman last night, and he has been here this
morning, but I raly don't see why <em>you</em> should trouble yourself
about it," sez Miss Josephine, a taking up her work, and a beginning
to sew as easy as she ever did in her life.</p>

<p>The 'pothecary was so mad, he couldn't but jest speak out loud.
"Look a here, Miss Burgess," sez he, a speaking sort of hoarse,
"aint we as good as married? didn't you engage yourself to me?
and wasn't the day eenajest sot afore that consarned etarnal
ball?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168] </a></span></p>
<p>"Not that I ever knew on," says Miss Burgess, a pinning a
pink bow on to a bonnet she was to work on, and a holding it
out to see how it looked, "I raly don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>The 'pothecary begun to tremble all over, he was so tarnal
mad to see her setting there as cool as a cucumber.</p>

<p>"You don't know what I mean, do you?" sez he. "Look a
here, marm, haint I been to see you off and on for more than a year?
Haint I footed up your books and made out bills and done all
your out-door business, this ever so long? Haint I give you
ounces on ounces of jujube paste, emptied a hull jar of lemon
drops, and more than half kept you in pearl powder and cold
cream?"</p>

<p>"Wal, you needn't talk so loud and tell everybody of it," sez
the milliner a going on with her work all the time, but the leetle
chap had got his grit up, and there was no "who" to him. On
he went like a house afire.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it me that stopped you from taking them are darn'd
Brandreth's pills. Didn't I tell you they warn't no better than
rank pisin, and that no rale lady would ever think of stuffing herself
with such humbug trash? I'll be choked if I don't wish I'd
let you swaller fifty boxes of 'em&mdash;I wish I had&mdash;I do by gracious!"</p>

<p>"Don't make such a noise," sez the milliner, "it wont do no
good, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Wont it though? wont it? I rather guess you'll find out in
the end. I'll sue you for a breach of promise&mdash;if I don't jest
tell me on't, that's all."</p>

<p>The 'pothecary was a going on to say a good deal more, but
jest as he begun to let off steam agin some customers come into
the front shop. Miss Josephine Burgess put down her work and
went out as if nothing on arth had happened. The 'pothecary
waited a few minits a biling over with spite, and then he kicked
a bonnet block across the room, upset a chair, and cut off through
the store like all possessed. The milliner was a bargaining away
with her customers for dear life&mdash;she looked up and larfed a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169] </a></span>easy, as the poor feller sneaked through the store, and that was
all she cared about it.</p>

<p>The poor coot of an apothecary went over to his shop and
slammed the door tu hard enough to shake the house down.
Then he went back of the counter, took down a jar full of corrosive
supplement and poured some on it out in a tumbler, but
somehow there was something in the thought of dying all of a
sudden, that didn't exactly come up to his idee of comfort; so he
poured back the pison and took a mint julep instead&mdash;that sort
of cooled him down a trifle&mdash;so he made up his mind to put off
drinking the pison till by-am-by.</p>

<p>Every day for three weeks that green buggy waggon, and the
tall man with the whiskers, stopped before Miss Josephine Burgess'
door. The 'pothecary grit his teeth and eyed the pisin with
so awful desperate look every time the buggy came in sight; and
when he heard that Miss Josephine Burgess was a gitting her
wedding frock made, and was raly a going to be married to a
foreign chap as rich as a Jew, that had fallen in love with her at
the Tammany ball, he filled the tumbler agin brimming full, and
then chucked the pison in the grate, and said he'd be darned if
he made sich an etarnal fool of himself any longer; the critter
wasn't worth taking a dose of salts for, much less a tumbler brim
full of pison. Arter this he bore up like a man; and one day
when he saw the green buggy come a trifle arlier than ever it did
afore, and see the tall chap jump out all dressed off tu kill, with
white gloves on, and a white hankercher a streaming out of
his coat pocket, he jest put his teeth together and looked on till
he saw Miss Josephine Burgess come out with a white silk bonnet
on, and a great long white veil streaming over it, and see her
take a seat in the buggy waggon with the tall man in whiskers.
It wasn't no news to him when he heard that Miss Josephine
Burgess was married, and had sold out her shop; but when he
heard that the young gal that took charge of the work-room had
got some relation to buy out the stock for her, the apothecary
brightened up like anything; and he was heard to say that arter
all the young gal that took charge of the work-room wasn't to
be grinned at in a fog; for his part, he thought her full as harnsome
as Miss Josephine Burgess.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170] </a></span></p>
<p>There was no two ways about it,&mdash;Miss Josephine Burgess was
raly married to the tall man in whiskers, and she had sold out to
the young gal that had taken charge of the work-room. About
three days arter the wedding, the tall man with whiskers sot in the
room over what had been Miss Josephine Burgess's store, and leetle
she that had been Miss Josephine Burgess herself, sot in the tall
man's lap, with one arm round his neck. Her purty slim fingers
had been a playing with his shiny black curls so long that
some of the black color came off and made them leetle fingers
look sort of smutty. Once in a while the bride would pat the
tall man's cheek and call him a naughty critter, and ask him how
many ladies he'd been in love with afore he see her; and the
tall man would say&mdash;"not one upon my honor!" at which she
would pat his cheek agin and say she didn't believe a word on
it. Then the tall man in whiskers would begin to look as if he
raly had been a killing critter with the women folks, and would
say that he wouldn't deny it&mdash;he had now and then his leetle
flirtations, like all men of rale fashion&mdash;but he'd never in his
whole life took <em>sich</em> a notion to a critter as he had to her. With
that Miss Josephine Burgess (that was) would fling both of her
arms round the tall man's neck, and declare that there was not
so proud and happy a critter on the hull arth as she was.</p>

<p>Wal, arter this, the tall man in wiskers took hold of the chain
that his bride had round her neck, and sez he, "My dear love, I
raly can't bear to see you rigged out in these ere old fashioned
things. When you was only a milliner they did well enough, but
now you musn't wear no jewelry that aint at the top of the
notch; jest pack all on 'em up, that are watch of your'n and all,
and I'll go and swap 'em off for a set of jewelry that's worth
while. When I take you hum among all my folks, they'd larf
at these awk'ard things."</p>

<p>With that the bride begun to looked streaked enough, so she
sot to work and lugged out all the gold things she had; her
watch and great heavy chain, and ear-rings, and ever so many
gim-cracks. So the tall man put them all in his pocket and took
up his hat, and sez he, "I'll soon get rid of these ere things, and
bring you something that is something."</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess that was, said there never was so kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171] </a></span>a critter, and jest to let her see that she wasn't much out in saying
that are, he cum back from the door, and sez he, "Seeing as
I'm a going out, I may as well take that are little sum of money
and put in some bank for you; of course I don't want anything
of it, but it raly don't seem jest safe here, among all these sewing
gals." Miss Josephine Burgess that was went to her chest
of drawers and took out a heap of bank bills and gave them to
him. The tall man in whiskers put the bills in his trousers'
pocket, buttoned it up tight, then give the pocket a leetle slap
and was a going out agin. But Miss Josephine Burgess that was
she follered arter and sticking her head through the door she
sung out sort of easy, sez she,</p>

<p>"My dear darling, you've forgot something!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so," sez the tall man in whiskers, and he stood
up straight as a loon's leg, "what is it&mdash;any more jewelry, my
pet?"</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" said Miss Josephine Burgess that was,
sort of sly, a twisting her head a one side, and pussing out her
mouth awful tempting.</p>

<p>"Oh," sez the man in whiskers, and then there was a little
noise as if a bottle of Newark cider had been uncorked kinder
easy.</p>

<p>"You'll come right straight back, dear?" sez Miss Josephine
Burgess that was, a running to the door agin&mdash;"you will, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Sartinly, my sweet love," sez the tall man in whiskers, a
stopping on the stairs and kissing her hand over the railing.</p>

<p>"By-by," sez Miss Josephine Burgess that was.</p>

<p>"By-by," sez the tall man in whiskers.</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess that was sot by the window and
looked arter the tall man till he got eenamost down to Chatham
square. She waited a hull hour and he didn't come back; then
she waited two hours; then all night; and the next week and
the next, till she'd been a waiting three hull months,&mdash;and arter
all the tall man in whiskers didn't seem to hurry himself a
bit.</p>

<p>About a year arter the Tammany ball, the leetle 'pothecary
was sitting in the back room of what once was Miss Josephine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172] </a></span>Burgess's milliner store&mdash;his wife that used to take charge of the
work-room, stood close by; and the 'pothecary was a looking over
his wife's day book. Jest as he was a adding up a tarnal long
row of figures, one of the hands come down stairs and was a going
out.</p>

<p>"Look a here, Miss Josephine Burgess, or Miss what's your
name." sez the 'pothecary, "if you're determined to go home
the minit your hour is up, these hurrying times, it's my idee that
you'd better look out for some other shop to work in."</p>

<p>The color riz up in the poor woman's face, but it was her turn
to be snubbed and drove about, without daring to say her soul
was her own. So instead of riling up, she spoke as meek as
could be, and sez she, "I aint very well, I've got a dreadful
headache."</p>

<p>"Cant help that," sez the 'pothecary, "we pay you twenty
shillings a week, fust rate wages, to <em>work</em>, so you may jest step
back to the work-room with your headache, or I'll dock off fifty
cents when it comes Saturday night if you don't. Go troop&mdash;I'll
have you to know you aint mistress in this shop, or master
neither."</p>

<p>Miss Josephine Burgess had a temper of her own, but she
owed for her board, and so choked in and went up stairs as
mad as all natur.</p>

<p>The apothecary's wife was a good hearted critter, and it raly
made her feel bad to see her old boss used so.</p>

<p>"Don't speak so to her," sez she to the 'pothecary, "she raly
looks tired and sick, don't hurt her feelings."</p>

<p>"Humbug," sez the 'pothecary, stretching himself up, and a
buttoning his trousers' pocket as pompously as could be, "humbug,
what bisness have sewing girls with feelings."</p>

<p>"I was a sewing gal once," sez the 'pothecary's wife.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and how did that darned stuck up critter use you, tell
me that?" sez he.</p>

<p>The 'pothecary's wife didn't answer; but the minit her husband
had gone out she went into the kitchen and took a bowl of
ginuine hot tea up to the work room. Miss Josephine Burgess
that was, sot on a stool looking as mad as a march hare; she began
to sew as soon as the 'pothecary's wife come in, as grouty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173] </a></span>as could be; but when the kind critter gin her the bowl of tea, and
told her it would be good for her head-ache, the poor sewing
girl boo-hooed right out a crying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Wal, arter writing that story about the Bowery Milliner, I begun
to think York was a going to be rather too hot to hold me.
All the boss milliners in York got into a tantrum and kicked up
sich a darned rumpus that I raly begun to be afear'd that they'd
cum down to my office in Cherry-street, and get up a fourth of
July oration, or a she caucus, and girt me to death in a pair of
them darned French corsets. But the peaked little working gals,
they were eenamost tickled to death with that story, and there
warn't no eend to the harnsome sweet critters that cum to my
office a crying and yet half a smiling, to thank me for taking up
on their side. One thing though made me feel bad enough.
That etarnal leetle stuck up old maid got so allfired wrothy that
she turned Susan Read out of her place, and cheated her out of
some of her wages too. Darn her it makes me gritty only jest
to think on it. But she'd better look out, I can tell her; for if
I take her up agin, consarn me if I don't use her up till she aint
bigger than the tip eend of a pine stick whittled down to nothing.</p>

<p>Wal, as the spring come on I began to git peaked, and every
morning felt sort of wamblecropped in my stomach when I
woke up. I s'pose it was cause I couldn't git pork and dandelines
and prime fresh young onions right out of the arth, as I
used tu to hum. The editors of the <i>Express</i>, they wanted me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174] </a></span>take an emetic, but I told 'em I couldn't think of sich a thing, it
was agin natur. I looked sort of solemn, jest as I always do
when they use any of them French words that I don't understand,
and made up my mind to look in Boyer's Dictionary,
and find out the meaning of emetic the fust thing arter I
got hum.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez they, "if you don't like that, Mr. Slick, s'posing
you take a trip to the Seat of Gineral Government, and see how
them Loco Foco chaps are a carrying on there, it'll answer all
the same."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, arter thinking it all over in arnest, "it seems to
me as if I was kinder hankering arter the green trees and the
grass and cows, and the wind that comes straight down from
heaven, where you can breathe it out on your own hook, and
not take it second hand, as we do in York. I raly think I should
feel like a new critter if I could only go hum a spell and weed
the young onions." With that I begun to think about the humsted,
and how it was gitting towards planting time; and think
sez I, par 'll miss me about these times, and marm too, for
she wont have any body to do her milking when it rains, nor
to bring water and du up all the leetle chores that I al'rs did for
her. Then I seemed to see our orchard all a leaving out thick
and kivered over with apple blows; and it seemed tu me as if I
was a setting on the stun wall, jest as I used to when I was a
leetle shaver, a looking how fast the grass grew and a wondering
how long it would be afore green apple time. There was the
well-crotch and the pole, and the bucket a hanging to it, as
plain as day, and the peach tree that grows by it chuck full of
pink blows. There was you a gitting out the oxen to go to ploughing,
and there was marm out in the meadow at the back door, a
picking plantin leaves for greens, with her old sun bonnet on,
and a tin pail to put the greens in.</p>

<p>Oh dear, how humsick I did feel! I could a boo-hooed right
out, if it would a done any good, when I sort of come tu, and
found out that I was setting in the <i>Express</i> office, with nothing
but picters of that old critter, Gineral Harrison, and a heap of
newspapers scattered every which way over the floor, to look at.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175] </a></span></p>
<p>"Wal," sez the Editor, sez he, "Mr. Slick, what do you think
about it? you raly ought to go to Washington, to see the President
and the lions."</p>

<p>I put one leg over t'other, and winked my eyelids for fear he'd
see how near I come to crying; and arter a leetle while, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"I haint no kind of doubt that that are Washington is a
smasher of a city; but somehow, if you'd jest as livs, I'd a leetle
ruther go hum."</p>

<p>"Yes," sez he, "I haint the least doubt on it; but then, if you
git out of the city, it don't make much difference which way
you go."</p>

<p>I see that he'd made up his mind to have his own way; but
think sez I, you don't git it without another tough pull, anyhow;
so sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"I raly feel as if I must doctor a leetle; and when a feller
feels tuckered out, or down-hearted, there is no place like hum,
if it's ever so homely,&mdash;and nobody can take care of a feller like
his own marm. Now I know jest how it'll be&mdash;the minit I git
hum, the old woman will go to making root-beer; she'll sarch
all over the woods for saxafax-buds to make tea on, and there'll
be no eend to the snake root and fennel seed bitters that she'll
make me drink. I raly feel as if I must go; so don't you say
any more about it," sez I; "I shall come back agin as bright as
a new dollar."</p>

<p>If there is anything on arth that holds on hard, it's a York
Editor; a lamper-eel is nothing to one on 'em. They'd have
their own way, if the Old Nick himself stood afore them as big
as the side of a house.</p>

<p>By-am-by the hull truth come out; sez the Editor, sez he, a
speaking as soft and mealy-mouthed as could be, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Slick, you can't write any letters for <em>us</em> in Weathersfield;
so jest make up your mind to start right off. You
can go hum any time."</p>

<p>"But I want to doctor," sez I.</p>

<p>"Oh, take a box of Sherman's cough lozengers," sez he, a
smiling; "they cured you last winter, you know." With that,
he let off a stream of soft sodder, sez he, "a man of your talents
oughtn't to bury himself in the country. The members of Congress
are all a-tip-toe to see you, and so are the gals in Washington&mdash;the
Russian Embassador's wife and all on 'em."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176] </a></span></p>
<p>It warn't in human natur to stand agin this; so I sort of
relented.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're a joking," sez I, a hitching on my chair;
"I don't raly s'pose the Washington gals ever heard of me
in their hull lives."</p>

<p>"Hain't they, though," sez he.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I should kinder like tu go, jest to see what
Congress people look like. I've a sort of a notion that mebby I
shall run for Congressman myself one of these days. I don't
believe there's a feller in all York better qualified. When I come
away from Weathersfield, I could lick any feller there, big or
leetle; and I've a sort of a sort of a notion that I can dress out
any of them varmints in the Capitol, if they do practice a leetle
more than I du."</p>

<p>The Editor of the Express, he larfed a leetle easy, and sez he,
"Well, Mr. Slick, it's all settled then&mdash;and the sooner you start
the better."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," sez I.</p>

<p>Wal, I went back tu the office and sot down, kinder loth tu
go so far from hum as Washington City, and yet anxious to
oblige the Editor of the Express; but all I could du, thoughts
of the humsted kept a crowding intu my mind till I couldn't
stand it no longer, but kivered up my face with both of my
hands and took tu crying like a sick baby. Jest then&mdash;while
I was a feeling dreadfully&mdash;somebody opened the door of my
office, and in walked Captain Doolittle, with his hand out, and
a grinning from ear tu ear as if he was eenajest tickled tu death
to see me agin.</p>

<p>I jumped right up and shook hands with him, while I turned
my face away and wiped my eyes with the cuff of my coat, for
I felt ashamed to let him ketch me a crying.</p>

<p>But there is no cheating that old coot, he's wide awake as
a night hawk.</p>

<p>"Jonathan," sez he, "What's the matter&mdash;you look as thin as
a shad in summer&mdash;consarn me if I don't believe you have been
boo-hooing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177] </a></span></p>
<p>"You've lost your guess this time," sez I, a trying to put on a
stiff upper lip.</p>

<p>The old feller, he looked in my face, and then agin on the cuff
of my coat&mdash;then he folded his arms and stepped back and eyed
me all over, and sez he at last,</p>

<p>"Jonathan, one thing is sartin, either you've been a crying, or
you've told a whopper to your old friend, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or what?" sez I, wiping the cuff of my coat on my trousers'
leg&mdash;"or what?"</p>

<p>"Or your deginerated&mdash;deginerated!" sez he, "deginerated
from the Weathersfield stock!"</p>

<p>"Wal, I don't seem to understand how you'll make that out,"
sez I.</p>

<p>"Jonathan," sez he, as arnest as could be, "there was tears
in your eyes jest as I come in, and you was ashamed on 'em.
Now, sich tears as a smart, honest young man may feel in his
eyes naturally, are nothing to be ashamed on; when he gets to
thinking of hum or old friends, or perhaps them that are dead
and gone,&mdash;the drops that come up unawares to moisten his eyes
are wholesome to his natur. I've seen the time, Jonathan, when
a minister's prayer didn't seem half so easing to the heart. An
honest chap might as well feel streaked about saying the Lord's
Prayer; for the tears that thinking of them that we love sets a
going, have eenamost as much religion in 'em as singing and
praying and going to meeting altogether. Prayer, Jonathan,
prayer falls upon the natur like the warm sun on a patch of
young onions&mdash;and tears, ginuine tears that come from tender
thoughts, Jonathan, darn me if they ain't the rain that keeps the
young shoots green. You wouldn't have been scared about my
seeing sich tears, Jonathan, and I know you've got tu much grit
for any other&mdash;you aint the chap to snuffle and cry because things
go crooked with you&mdash;I'm sartin of that."</p>

<p>"I reckon you may be," sez I.</p>

<p>"Wal, Jonathan," says the captin, a folding his arms close up
to the red shirt that kivered his bosom, "there aint but one way
of accounting for it. I never would a believed it, but you've
deginerated. These Yorkers have larned you to be ashamed of
eating onions&mdash;it's jest arter dinner time&mdash;I see through it all&mdash;you've
been a thinking of hum, and tried a raw onion for once&mdash;your
eyes aint used to it now, and that's what makes 'em so
red and misty. I have seen the time, Jonathan Slick, when you
could cut up a hull peck without winking; I've seen you cronch
one like a meller apple; and now, arter living in York, this is
the eend on't."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178] </a></span></p>
<p>"Come, captin," sez I, a holding out my hand, "don't make
a coot of yourself, I can eat a raw onion without winking as well
as ever I could. Seeing as you can peak so consarned far into a
mill-stun, I may as well own up and settle the hash to once. I've
been kinder peaked and hum-sick ever since spring opened. I
sot down here all alone, got a thinking of old times and things
to hum, and that sort of made me cry afore I knew it; that's the
hull truth, and I'd jest as livs you knew it as not."</p>

<p>Captin Doolittle, he gin my hand a grip, and sez he, "That's
right, Jonathan, own up like a man, I see intu it now&mdash;hum-sick
as git out&mdash;just what I wanted. The old sloop is ready to sail
right off&mdash;pack up your saddle-bags, jump aboard, and we'll be
in Weathersfield in less than no time. Your par and mar, and
Judy White, and all the folks tu hum will be tickled eenamost tu
death to see you."</p>

<p>I felt my heart jump right intu my mouth, but it sunk agin
like a chunk of lead when I thought that I'd eenajest agreed to
go tu Washington. "Captin," sez I, "I'm afeared I can't go&mdash;I've
nigh about promised to go tu Washington City."</p>

<p>"Washington City be darned," sez he, a going intu my back
room and a lugging out my saddle-bags; "Washington City can't
hold a candle tu Weathersfield this time of the year. You can't
think how fresh and green everything looks; the square before
the meeting-house is as green as grass can be&mdash;the laylock trees
in front of the humstead are all in full blow&mdash;we've had young
lettuce and pepper-grass there these three weeks&mdash;think of that!
with good sharp vinegar, plenty of pepper and salt, and a sprinkle
of young onion-tops mixed in jest as they come from the
patch by the eend of the barn,&mdash;Gosh, but don't it make your
mouth water only to think on it, Jonathan."</p>

<p>"I swow, captin, there's no standing it, I must go."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179] </a></span></p>
<p>"Sartinly you must&mdash;the old woman would go off the handle
if I should come back without you and Judy White. That Judy
is a nation harnsome gal, Jonathan. She told me tu jest mention
that the orchard over agin the house was in full blow and every
tree chuck full of robins' nests. You can smell that orchard
half-a-mile off, Jonathan, but Judy says it kinder makes her
molencholy tu see the trees a budding out so agin, and the birds
a singin from mornin to night among 'em, and nobody tu enjoy
it but her."</p>

<p>"I'll go, by gauly offalus&mdash;I'll go," sez I, "but what will the
editors of the Express say," sez I, feelin all over in spots about
goin off so.</p>

<p>"The Express go tu grass," sez Captin Doolittle, a crowding
my pepper and salt trousers intu the saddle-bags.</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I, a helping him strap up the bags; "I'll write
a letter hum tu say I'm jest a startin, and send it through the Express,
and that will let the editors know what I've detarmined on."</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez Captin Doolittle, "and I guess I'll go down to
the sloop with the saddle-bags. I only jest got in last night,
took out the ladin this morning, and we shall be a cuttin down
the East river afore sunset; quick work, I reckon, don't you
think so, Jonathan?"</p>

<p>"I should rather think it was," sez I.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, a shoulderin the saddle-bags, "write off the
letter and come right down. You mustn't let the grass grow
under your feet, now I tell you. Your marm will be about the
tickledest critter that you ever sot eyes on when you git back
agin&mdash;she's got a hull lot of winter apples saved up yit agin you
cum. I wish you could a seen the old critter a knittin away all
the long winter evenings tu git you a hull grist of socks made
up; she seamed every darned one on 'em clear through, jest
because it was for you, Jonathan."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" sez I, kinder half cryin agin; "now du
git out, will you? I want tu write my letter."</p>

<p>With that, the Captin he went off saddle-bags and all. I sot
down and wrote off this letter about the quickest, I can tell you.
I shall send it up tu the Express office, and if we have good luck,
it won't be long arter you git it afore you will shake hands with us.</p>

<p>JONATHAN SLICK RETURNED.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan's Arrival in New York from the onion beds at Weathersfield&mdash;Jonathan
puts up at the Astor House&mdash;His notion of that
great heap of stones&mdash;Jonathan's Ideas of a New York Cab, and
the usual quarrel of a Stranger with Cabmen&mdash;A Sensation is
created at the Astor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Here I am down in York agin, as large as life and as springy
as a steel trap. Hurra! but don't it make a feller feel as suple
as a green walnut gad to have these stun side walks under his
shoe leather once more! I raly felt as if I could a'most have
jumped over the housen, eend foremost, I was so glad to git
ashore at Peck Slip. Captin Doolittle, he kept his gab a going,
a hull hour, a trying to make out it warn't worthy a ginuine
Yankee to hanker after the York big bugs so. Now my opinion
is, Captin Doolittle ain't no bad judge of onions and other garden
sarse, and he did run the old sloop down here as slick as grease,
but when he sets himself up to talk about genteel society, he
raly is green.</p>

<p>Look a here, par, did I ever tell you what a looking place that
Astor House is? If I didn't, jest you suppose that all the stun
walls in old Connecticut had been hewed down as smooth as
glass, and heaped together, one a-top of t'other, over two acres
of clearing, up and up, half away to the sky and a leetle over;
suppose then the hull etarnal great heap cut up into winders and
doors, with almighty great slabs of stun piled up for steps and
pillars standing on eend, on the top, to hold them down&mdash;bigger
than the highest oak tree you ever sot eyes on, and then you
have some idee what a whopping consarn that Astor House is.</p>

<p>At fust I felt a leetle skeery at going to board there, for think
sez I, if they charge according to the size of the house, I guess
it'll make my puss strings ache; but, think sez I agin, the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181] </a></span>taverns, according to my experience, all'rs charge the leastest
prices, I will give 'em a try any how.</p>

<p>I gin a cuffy on the wharf two cents to go and get a carriage
for me, for I meant to du the thing up in genteel style, and cut
the hull figger when I once begun. Besides, the cabin was so
stived up with onion barrels and heaps of red cabbages, besides
the turnips and winter squashes, that I hadn't no room to fix up
in till I got a hum somewhere else, and my dandy clothes have
got a leetle the wus for wear, and don't cut quite so much of a
dash as they used tu. I hadn't but jest time to rub them down
a trifle with a handful of oat straw that I took from one of the
winter apple barrels, and to slick down my hair a few, with both
my hands, when the nigger cum back and said he couldn't find a
carriage, but he'd got a fust rate cab.</p>

<p>Sartinly that cab was one of the darndest queer animals that
ever run arter a hoss. It looked like a set of stairs on wheels,
with a great overgrown leather trunk sot on eend half way up,
with the lid turned over one side. The horse was hitched to the
lowermost step, and on the top step of all, clear back, sot a feller
histed up in the air with a great long whip, and lines that reached
clear over the hull consarn to the horse's head, and this chap
was the driver; but he looked as if he'd been sot there wrong
eend foremost, and felt awfully streaked and top-heavy about it.
It raly was curious to watch the chap as he laid his lines on the
top of the box and crept down stairs to stow away my saddle-bags
and the hair trunk that marm gin me. When he'd got
through, I jest lifted one foot from the ground, and there I sot in
a little cushioned pen, like a rooster in a strange coop, or a rat in
an empty meal bin. The feller slam'd tu the door and went up
the steps behind agin, then I ketched sight of the lines a dangling
over head, like a couple of ribbon snakes a twisting about
in the sunshine; and away we went trundling along like a great
oversized wheelbarrow, with a horse before, a driver behind, and
a poor unfortunate critter like me cooped in the middle, with a
trunk and pair of saddle-bags for company.</p>

<p>Well, on we went hitch-a-te-hitch, jerk-a-ty-jerk through the
carts and horses till we got out of the slip, and then we kept on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182] </a></span>a leetle more regular till by-and-by the horse he stopped all of
himself jest afore the Astor House.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I to the driver, a feeling in my trousers' pocket
for a ninepence&mdash;for the nigger told me that them new fangled
cabs had sot up a sort of cheap opposition to the hacks&mdash;so
sez I,</p>

<p>"Wal, what's the damage?"</p>

<p>"Only a dollar," sez he, a giving my saddle-bags and trunk a
jerk onto the steps, and eying my old dandy clothes sort of supercilious,
as if he thought it would be a tough job for me to
hand over the chink. I begun to rile up a leetle, but arter a
minit I happened to think that no ginuine gentleman ever gits
mad with sich a ruff scuff, so I jest looked in his face, and sez I,</p>

<p>"How you talk!"</p>

<p>With that I gin him a quarter of a dollar, for I didn't want to
be mean; but the varmint begun to bluster up as if he wanted to
kick up a tantrum. I didn't seem to mind it, but the critter
hung on yit for a whole dollar, like a dog to a sassafras root, and
when some waiters cum down and took away my things, he followed,
and ketching hold of the saddle-bags, said the things
shouldn't go till he'd got his pay. With that I went up to him
agin, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Make yourself scarce, you etarnal mean coot, or I'll give you
the purtyest specimen of Weathersfield sole leather that you
ever sot eyes on&mdash;one that'll send you up them wheelbarrow
steps of yourn swifter than you cum down, a darned sight. You
needn't look at me&mdash;I'm in arnest, and I'll du it, or my name
aint Jonathan Slick."</p>

<p>Oh human natur', how the varmint wilted down when I said
this; he took off his hat, and sez he&mdash;as mean as a frozen potater&mdash;says
he,</p>

<p>"I didn't know as it was you."</p>

<p>"I rather guess you didn't," says I.</p>

<p>The feller seemed to feel so sheepish that it sort of mollified
me, and so I up and gave him another four-pence-ha'penny.
With that I went up the steps, up and up till I cum to a great
long stun hall that reached tu all creation, with a kind of a bar-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183] </a></span>at one end. It was a sort of a stun side-walk a shut up in
a house; for lots of men were talking and walking about as easy
as if they'd been in the street. I went up to the bar-room, where
a chap sot with sour looks, as if he felt to hum all over, and
says I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you take in boarders here?"</p>

<p>The chap looked at me from the top of my head to the sole of
my foot, as if he'd never seen a full sized Yankee in his life; and
after fidgeting about, says he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, we du sometimes, but mebby you've mistook the place."</p>

<p>"I reckon not," says I. "How much du you charge a week?
I paid two dollars and fifty cents down in Cherry-street, but I
s'pose you go as high as four dollars, or say four fifty."</p>

<p>The feller looked sort of flustered; so thinks says I, I haint
got up the notch yet, so I'll give one more hist.</p>

<p>"Wal, sir, it goes agin the grain; but seeing as it's the Astor
House, per'aps I might give as high as five dollars, if you'd
throw in the washing. I aint hard on clothes, say a shirt and
three dickeys, with a pair of yarn socks a week, and a silk hankercher
once a fortnight. I shall have to be a trifle extravagant
in that line."</p>

<p>The feller grew red in the face, and looked as if he was tickled
tu death at gitting such an offer. Think sez I, I hope to gracious
I haint made a coot of myself, and bid up too high. I got
so consarned before the chap spoke, that I sort of wanted to git
off edgeways. There was a great day-book a lying by him, and
sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see you trust out board by your books; but I'm ready to
hand over every Saturday night; so per'haps you'll take less for
cash."</p>

<p>The feller sort of choked in a larf, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"That aint a day-book, only one we keep for folks that come
here to write down their names in."</p>

<p>Think sez I, I guess I'll write my name, and then he'll see that
he's got hold of a cute hand for a bargain, and may dock off a
trifle on that are five dollars.</p>

<p>"O," sez I, "that's it; well, give us hold here, and I'll write
my name right off for you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184] </a></span></p>
<p>The feller handed over the pen. I stretched out my right arm,
turned the cuff of my coat over, flourished off a long-tailed J,
till the ink spattered all over the book; then I streaked along to
the S, curled it up harnsomely, and finished off with a <span class="smcap">k</span> that
would have made Mr. Goldsmith, the writing-master, in Broadway,
feel awk'ard if he'd seen it.</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen that Astor House chap, when he
read the name; he looked as if he didn't know what to du, but
at last he stepped back, and he made a bow, and sez he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, we are glad to see you at the Astor House, and we
hope you'll stay with us as long as you remain in the city!"</p>

<p>I made him a snubbed sort of a bow, for I didn't want him to
think I was over anxious to stay till we'd clinched the bargain
about the board, and sez I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wal, now about the price of your fodder; I s'pose you'll
dock a leetle on that offer of mine. It's an allfired hard price,
now ain't it?"</p>

<p>"O," sez he, "never mind the board, Mr. Slick, we shan't be
hard with you on that score. The man will show you a room,
and I hope you'll feel yourself quite to hum with us."</p>

<p>With that a feller cum up to look at the big book, and then
he whispered to another, and it wasn't two minits afore a hul
squad of fellers cum around, as if I'd been a bear set up for a
show, at a copper a head.</p>

<p>One of the chaps he cut up stairs like all possessed, as if he
was a going tu bring up somebody else, so I begun to think it
about time for me to cut stick; so I hollered arter a waiter, and
told him to take me up where he'd put my trunk. The chap
went ahead, and I follered arter.</p>

<p>I tell you what, it wants a steady head to navigate through
all them long entry ways, and up them stairs, around and across
every which way, as I did, till I came to a room door up at the
tip top of the house. My head went around like a fly-trap.
When the door was shut I was so dizzy, I opened the winder,
and looked out tu see if the cold air wouldn't du me good. O
gracious me! didn't it make me ketch my breath tu see how high
up they'd stuck me. The clouds seemed to be purty close neighbors.
I looked right straight over the biggest trees in the park,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185] </a></span>as if they'd been black alder bushes, and my nose cum jest about
on a line with the City Hall clock. It sartinly did make me feel
a leetle skittish to look down into Broadway. The men went
streaking along like a crowd of good-sized rats a going out a
visiting, and the gals that went sidling along under their parasols,
were the darndest harnsome little finefied things I ever dreamed
of. It seemed as if all the wax dolls had broke loose from the
store winders, and was a walkin out to take the air with each on
'em a toad-stool to keep the sun of. Taking the hul together,
men and gals, coaches, cabs, trees, and horses, it was about the
funniest sight I ever sot eyes on.</p>

<p>It was worth while to look down on the front of the housen
too, only one felt all the time as if he was a goin to topple down
head fust. The winder to my room wasn't none of the largest,
and a round vine, all cut out of the solid stun, was twistified
round it on the outside; and a heap of the same sort stretched
along the right and left side like a string of purty picters hung
out for show. Think sez I, if any body would look up and see
me a standing here, they might see the true profile of Jonathan
Slick cut off at the shoulders and hung in a frame, a live picter,
without paint or whitewash. I wish to gracious some of them
York artists would paint me jest so, for I raly must a looked like
a picter while I stood in that winder, but it made me worse insted
of better, so I hauled in my head.</p>

<p>Arter I'd gin myself a good sudsing in the wash-hand basin,
I unbuckled my saddle-bags, and thought I'd fix up a leetle, for
somehow my clothes seemed to smell sort of oniony arter sleeping
so long in the sloop cabin. Since I've been hum my hair has
grown about right, only it's a leetle sun-burnt; but that don't
show much when I've combed it out slick with a fine tooth comb,
and rubbed it down with a ball of pomatum, scented with wintergreen.
I parted it straight down the middle, like some of the
gals afore class meeting; and I slicked it down with both hands,
till it glistened like a black cat in the dark.</p>

<p>Arter I'd purty near satisfied myself with that, I sot tu and
put on the red and blue checkered trousers that marm cut and
made arter my dandy clothes made in York. They are a ginuine
fit, except that they strain rather severe on the galluses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186] </a></span>pucker jest the leastest mite about the knee jints; but they aint
so coarse for all tow, nor the cam-colored coat neither. The
cotton dicky that you and Judy fixed up for me, curled up around
my chin and under the ears about the neatest; they looked as
good as linen, every mite; and when I twisted that checkered
silk scarf, that Judy gave me for a keep-sake arter she got mollified
about my going to York, around my neck, and let the long
ends, fringe and all, hang down sort of careless over my green
vest, criscrossed with red streaks, I ruther guess you haint seen
a chap of my size dressed up so in a long time.</p>

<p>You know that great harnsome broach that I bartered away
the apple sarse for in Hartford last fall. Wal, I was jest a sticking
that into my shirt bosom, and a thinking what a consarned
harnsome feller was a peaking at me out of the looking glass,
when somebody knocked at the door. I stopped to twistify
my dicky down a trifle, and to shake a leetle speck of essence of
wintergreen on my hankercher, and then I went to the door.</p>

<p>One of the chaps that I'd seen down stairs was there; he
didn't say nothing, but made a bow and gin me a piece of stiff
paper about as big as the ace of spades, with "Fanny Elssler"
printed right in the middle on it.</p>

<p>Wal, think sez I, "what on arth <em>does</em> this mean? I haint seen
a door yard fence nor a post since I come to York, but this ere
etarnal name was stuck up on it, and now I'll be choked if it
haint chased me up here into the tip top of the Astor House."
As I was a thinking of this, I kinder turned the paper in my
hand, and there on t'other side was a heap of the purtyest leetle
finefied writing that I ever did see. It was as plain as print,
and as fine as a spider's web, but I couldn't make out a word of
it to save my life.</p>

<p>I never was so flustrated in my born days, but arter thinking
on it a jiffy, I seemed to understand it, and was sartin that somebody
had writ a new fangled sort of a letter to Fanny Ellsler,
and had sent it to my room instead of her'n.</p>

<p>I run out into the entry way and hollered "hellow" to the
chap like all natur, but he'd made himself scarce, and so I went
back agin. I swanny, if I knew how to fix it. I didn't want
the pesky critter's letter, and then agin, I didn't much want to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187] </a></span>go and carry it to her, for fear she'd take me for one of them
long-haired, lantern-jawed coots that hanker round sich foreign
she critters, like lean dogs a huntin around a bone. But then
agin I raly had a sort of a sneaking notion to see her, if I could
as well as not. So I up and went to the looking glass and gin
my hair a slick or two, and took, a sort of gineral survey, to be
sartin that I was according to gunter.</p>

<p>There wasn't no mistake in that chap, I can tell you. Everything
was smooth as amber-grease, and my hair was so shiney
and slick that a fly would a slipped up if he'd ventured to settle
on it. I ony jest pulled the corner of my new handkercher out
of my coat pocket a trifle, then I put my hat on with a genteel
tip upwards, and down I went, chomping a handful of peppermint
drops as I went along in case my breath hadn't quite
got over the smell of fried onions that Captin Doolittle gin me
for breakfast aboard the sloop.</p>

<p>"Look a here," sez I to a chap that I cum across in one of the
entryways as I was a trying to circumnavigate down stairs, "you
don't know where abouts Miss Elssler lives, now du you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sez he, a stopping short, "she has the large parlor in
front, jest over the great entrance on the second floor."</p>

<p>"What! she don't live here in the Astor House, does she?"
sez I,</p>

<p>"Sartinly," sez he.</p>

<p>"You don't say so," sez I.</p>

<p>"Yes I <em>do</em> say so," sez he, a larfin.</p>

<p>"Wal, now I cum to think on it I guess you du," sez I; "but
I say now, you hadn't jest as livs as not go and show me the
door, had you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I haint no particular objections," sez he, and with that
he begun twistifying down stairs and around and across, and I
arter him like the tail to a kite, till by-am-by he hauled up close
to a room door, and arter saying, "this is the room," and giving
a bow, cut off before I'd time to ask him how his marm was.</p>

<p>JONATHAN SLICK AND FANNY ELSSLER.</p>

<p class="chaphead">A live Yankee and the Parisian Danseuse&mdash;Fanny sends her Card
and Jonathan makes a call&mdash;Down East Yankee and French-English
rather hard to be understood&mdash;Jonathan quite killed off by
Fanny's Curchies and Dimples&mdash;A little sort of a Flirtation&mdash;An
Invitation to see Fanny in Nathalie, which is accepted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>I swow, I thought I should a choked, my heart riz so when I
see that I'd got to go in alone, and when I took hold of the
chunk of brass that opens the door, I felt the blood a biling up
into my face like hot sap in a sugar kettle. I kinder half opened
the door, and then I kinder shut it agin; arter ketching a good
long breath I give the door a rap, and begun to pull up my dicky
sort of careless to let 'em know I wasn't scared nor nothing, and
then I rapped agin.</p>

<p>Gracious! before I took my fist away, the door opened softly
as if it slid on ile, and there stood a woman sort of harnsome
and sort a not, with a leetle cap chuck full of posies stuck on
the back of her head, a looking me right in the face as cosey as
if she'd been acquainted with me when I was a nussing baby. I
put my foot out to give her my primest bow, but think sez I,
mebby it aint Miss Elssler arter all; she looks too much like an
old maid for that; so I gin my foot a jerk in and my hand a
genteel flurish towards her, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you du marm?"</p>

<p>She looked at me sort of funny, and her mouth begun to pucker
itself up, but sez she, "How do you du?" a biting off the
words as short as pie crust.</p>

<p>"Purty well, I'm obliged to you," sez I, "Miss Elssler aint to
hum, is she?"</p>

<p>The critter looked at me as sober as a clam in high water, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189] </a></span>yet she seemed to be kinder tickled inside of her, and turning her
head round she let out a stream of stuff to somebody inside. It
wasn't talking, nor singing, nor scolding, nor yet was it crying,
but some sort of sounds kept a running off from her tongue as
soft as a brook over a bed of white pebble stuns, and about as
fast tu. She kept her hand a running up and down as if she'd
half a notion to beat time to her own new fashioned singing, till
all tu once, up cum a critter from t'other eend of the room, all
dressed in white, as if she'd jest cum out of a band-box, with
allfired harnsome black hair sleeked down each side of her face,
with a hull swad of it twisted up behind, with a golden pin stuck
through the heap, like one of marm's spindles spiked through a
hunk of flax. The head of the pin was as big as a shag-bark
walnut, and some sort of stun was sot in it that was like a gal's
mind, no two minits alike&mdash;now it was red, now yaller, now
green, and again all these colors seemed jumbled together and a
flashing inside of it till you couldn't tell which was which. I
swanny, if it didn't glisten so that I eenamost forgot that it was
stuck in a woman's head, and that she was a looking into my
face as mealy-mouthed and soft as could be.</p>

<p>"Has the gentleman mistook the room," sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>The words were sort of snipped off, but oh gracious, warn't
they sweet! lasses candy and maple sugar was in every syllable.
It seemed as if the critter had been fed forever on nothing but
mellow peaches and slippery elm bark, she spoke so soft. She
kinder smiled tu, but it was nat'ral as could be. Think sez I
mebby the coot has led me into the wrong goose pen, but there
aint no help for it now. So I jest walked a step for'ard, and
sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you du marm?"</p>

<p>"I kinder guess there aint no mistake worth a mentioning. If
Miss Elssler aint to hum I'll make tracks and cum agin, it aint no
trouble, I'd just as livs as not, but I guess I'll leave this ere letter
for fear she may want it. Some etarnal coot brought it up to
my room, but I suppose the critter didn't know no better&mdash;some
of these York chaps are green as young potatoes, don't you think
so, marm?"</p>

<p>I didn't wait for no answer, but handed over the new fangled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190] </a></span>letter, and was a going right off agin, but she looked at the letter
sort of astonished, and then at me, till I didn't know what to
make of it. Arter a minit, sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why dis is the card for Mr. Slick, one of de Editors of de
<i>Express</i> who has just arrived; certainly he could not be so rude
as to send it back again."</p>

<p>Oh gracious! think sez I, "Jonathan Slick, if you haint broke
your onion string now!"</p>

<p>"Was the gentleman out?" sez she, looking at the paper, and
then at me agin.</p>

<p>Think sez I&mdash;"You'd better ask his marm," for I'll be darned
if he can tell that, or anything else. I aint quite sartin if he
knows jest this minit which eend his head's on. But there's
nothing like keeping a stiff upper lip in sich places as York. In
less than half a jiffy I reached out my hand sort of easy, and
took the paper out of her hand, and then I gin her a smile, as
much as to say, aint I a careless shote? and, sez I,</p>

<p>"Now I swanny, did you ever! Well now who'd a thought
it,"&mdash;and with that I began to feel in my vest, and dug my hands
down in my trousers' pockets, as if I'd give the wrong paper,
and had lost something else, and wouldn't give up till I'd found
it. I didn't seem content till I'd pulled out my yaller hankercher
and shook it, and then I stopped still, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Now if this don't beat all, aint I the beatermost feller for
losing things? Howsomever, it's well it aint no worse. I can
write another almost any time. Jest tell Miss Elssler that Mr.
Slick has called in to thank her for her harnsome little keepsake,
and that he's felt awfully wamblecropped when he found out she
wasn't to hum."</p>

<p>The woman that come to the door fust, she looked at the other
and begun gabbling away, and then the black haired one, sez she,</p>

<p>"Oh, Mister Sleeke, pardon! pardon! I am so sorry to keep
you so long standing. I did not know! walk in, walk in. I am
most happy to see gentlemen of de press&mdash;most happy of any to
see Mister Sleeke." With that she stepped back and made the
purtyest leetle curchy that ever I see; it was like a speckled
trout diving into a brook jest enough to give a curve to the water
and no more.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191] </a></span></p>
<p>"Oh dear!" think sez I, "Jonathan Slick, if you havn't been
a weeding in the wrong bed agin. That critter is Fanny Elssler
as true as all creation; no woman on arth could make sich a
curchy but her." I guess my face blazed up a few, but I seen
that there was no backing out, so not to be behind hand in good
manners I stepped back, put out my foot with a flourish that
made the seams to my new trousers give; then I drew my right
heel into the hollow of my left foot, and kept a bending for'ard
all the time with a sort of deliberate gentility, till my eyes had to
roll up the leastest mite to keep sight of her'n. Then I drew up
agin easy, like a jack-knife with a tough spring, and finished off
with a flurish of my hand up to my hat and back agin; that last
touch left me standing parpendic'lar right before her, as a free
born citizen of America ought tu.</p>

<p>"Miss Elssler," sez I, "how do you du? You haint no idea how
tickled I am to see you."</p>

<p>That and the bow of mine did the bisness for her. I never
did see a critter act so tickled&mdash;the dimples kept a coming and
going round that sweet mouth of her'n like the bubbles on a
glass of prime cider. Her eyes were brimful of funny looks, and
she grew harnsomer every minit. Her face realy was like a picture
book; every time I took a peak it seemed as if she'd turned
over a new leaf with a brighter pictur painted on it.</p>

<p>She went along towards a bench all cushioned off, that looked
as if it was tu good to be sot on, and there she stood a waving
that white hand, as much as to say, set down here Mr. Slick,
and don't be particlar about gitting too fur off from them square
pillars for I shall set agin them myself.</p>

<p>I made her a kind of a half bow, and then arter giving my
hand a wave to match her'n,&mdash;sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arter you is manners for me."</p>

<p>The critter understands what good manners is; her black eyes
begun to sparkle and the smile came around her little mouth
thicker and faster, like lady bugs around a full blown rose. I
begun to feel to hum with her right off, so when she sot down
and looked into my face with them sarcy mischievous eyes of
her'n, and hitched up to the square cushion sort of inviting, I
jest divided my coat tail with both hands and sot down tu.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192] </a></span>But when I got down I'll be darned if I knew what on arth to
talk about; I stretched one of my new boots out on the carpet,
and then crossed t'other over it and then I did it all over agin,
but still I kept growing more and more streaked, till by-am-by
I jest sidled towards her kind of insinivating, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wal, Miss Elssler, what's the news?"</p>

<p>"E&mdash;a de what," sez she, a looking puzzled half to death.</p>

<p>"Oh nothing partic'lar," sez I. "I swow, Miss Elssler,
you've got a tarnal purty foot&mdash;git out you critter you!" and
with that I gave my yaller hankercher a flirt and upset a fly
that had lit on the tip eend of her finefied silk shoe. Arter I'd
finished his bisness, I folded up my hankercher and wiped my
nose, and then put it in my pocket agin. Then I begun to think
it was best to take a new start, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Its rather pleasant weather for the season, don't you think
so&mdash;beautiful day yesterday, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>She gave me one of her sweet smiles, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes it was, indeed. I was on board one French vessel in
the harbor yesterday, and was so delighted."</p>

<p>"What sort of a consarn was it?" sez I, "a sloop mebby"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh no," sez she, "it was a <em>La Belle Poule</em>."</p>

<p>"Oh," sez I, "they don't call them sloops in France, I s'pose;
but I say, Miss Elssler, have you ever been aboard a regular
Yankee craft, say a Connecticut river sloop or a two mast
schooner from down East? them's the ginuine sea birds for you!
Now my Par's got one a lying down to Peck Slip that'll take the
shine off from any of your Bell pulls or Bell ropes either, I'll bet
a cookey. I should raly like to show you the critter, I'm sartin
Captin Doolittle would go off the handle, he'd be so tickled.
Supposing you and I go down some day and git a peep at her,
and take a glass of cider and a cold bite in the cabin. Now
what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be very happy;" sez she, yet I thought she looked
kinder puzzled, and so to make her feel easy about it sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't be oneasy about the trouble, it won't be no put out to
Captin Doolittle, he's al'rs on hand for a spree. Supposing we
set day after to-morrow, it's best to give the old chap time to
slick up a leetle," sez I.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193] </a></span></p>
<p>"Any time that pleases Mr. Sleeke," sez she, a bowing her
head.</p>

<p>I wish to gracious Par, you could hear how the critter talks.
She nips off some words and strings out others, like a baby jest
larning. The way she draws out Mr. Slick is funny enough,
you'd think she'd been greasing her tongue to do it fust rate.</p>

<p>Wal, arter we'd settled about the sloop, there come another
dead calm and I begun to feel awk'ard agin, so I got up and went
to a table that was a'most kivered over with tumblers and chiny
cups, stuffed full of posies, and taking one of 'em up, I stuck my
nose into the middle on it and giv a good snuff. By the time I
got through, Miss Elssler she cum and stood close by me, alooking
so tempting that I bust rite out and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swan, Miss Elssler, its eenamost as sweet as your face."</p>

<p>She looked at me again, sort of wild, as if she wasn't used to
have folks praise her, so I choked in, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you fond of posies?"</p>

<p>She chewed up some soft words that I couldn't make out, and
then sez I agin&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've got a swad of 'em here, any how. Some of your
beaus sent them to you, now, I'll bet something."</p>

<p>"Oh," sez she, a larfing, "dey were all flung on de stage last
night, de new York gentlemen dey are <em>so</em> gallant."</p>

<p>I said nothing but kept a darned of a thinking. There wasn't
a ginuine prime posey among 'em, nothing but leetle finefied
roses, and buds and leaves, and white posies tied up in bunches,
jest sich leetle things as a feller might give to a young critter of a
gal that he took a notion tu, but no more fit for sich a smasher
as Miss Elssler than a missionary psalm book. She begun to untie
one of the bunches, and stuck a few into her bosom, and then
she twisted the ribbon round a harnsome red rose and a heap of
green leaves, and puckering up that sweet mouth of her'n, she
gin it to me with a half curchy. Gaury! didn't my heart flounder,
and didn't the fire flash up into my eyes. I pinned the
rose into my shirt bosom with my new broach, and then I looked
at the posies that lay on her bosom so tantalizing, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh dear! how I wish I was a honey bee&mdash;I guess I know
what bunch of posies I'd settle in."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194] </a></span></p>
<p>She didn't seem to know how to take this, and I was eenamost
scared into a caniption fit to think what I'd been a saying.
Think sez I, now Jonathan, if you hain't done it! I ruther
guess you'd better cut dirt, and not try agin; so I took out my
watch, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious! its time for me to be a going. Don't
forgit, our bargin is clinched about the sloop, will you now, Miss
Elssler?"</p>

<p>With that I edged towards the door, and arter making another
prime bow, I went out, feeling sort of all-overish, I can't tell
how. I kinder think she wasn't very wrothy arter all, for
she curchied and smiled so, I guess there wasn't much harm
done.</p>

<p>The minit I got to my room I was all in a twitter to find out what
was on the paper Miss Elssler had sent to me, for I hadn't found out
yet. Every word that I could make out was, Madame ma Selle
Elssler, and something that looked like compliments spelt wrong:
you can't think how I was puzzled. I turned the paper upside
down, and up, and every which way, but if the rest wasn't writ
in some sort of hog Latin, I hadn't no idee what it was, for I
couldn't make out another word, so at last I chucked the paper
onto the mantel-shelf, for I wouldn't hold in no longer, and sez
I, all alone to myself, as wrathy as could be, sez I,</p>

<p>"Madam ma Selle Elssler, and be darned, for what I care; I
wish to gracious she knew how to write coarser."</p>

<p>By-am-by I took up the thing agin, for it made me feel sheepish
to think I couldn't make out to read so much Latin as a gal
could write, arter going to grammar school so long, but it wasn't
of no use, so think sez I, I'll jest go down to the bar-room and
see where the critter is to be sold, and what madam it is that's
going to knock her off. So down I went, and sez I to the man
sort of easy, sez I,</p>

<p>"So you're a going to have an auction here, aint you?"</p>

<p>The chap looked up, and at fust he didn't seem to know me
agin in my fix up, but arter a minit he smiled, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Dear me, Mr. Slick, is it you agin? An auction! no, not as
I know on."</p>

<p>"Oh!" sez I, and with that I begun to twistify the square paper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195] </a></span>about in my fingers, and at last I seemed to be a reading it as
arnest as could be, all the while a leaning sort of easy towards
him as if I'd forgot he was there. He kept a eyeing it kinder
slantindicular, till at last, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's purty writing, Mr. Slick&mdash;a lady's, I should think?"</p>

<p>"Mebby you've seen it afore," sez I, a trying to look careless,
and as if I'd read every word on't a dozen times. "Ruther
scrumptous leetle curlecues them are, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>With that I handed over the pesky thing kind of nat'ral, as
if I didn't really think what I was a doing, and he seemed to
read it off as easy as water.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," sez he, "this is her <em>own</em> handwriting; a great compliment,
Mr. Slick. I know of many a fine feller that would
give his ears to get sich a card from 'the Elssler.'"</p>

<p>"Oh," sez I, "if she has a notion for ears, she'd better bargain
for them Baltimore chaps that we've heard on. She'll get
prime ones there, as long as beet leaves, but I'm afeared she'll
find 'em ruther scarce here in York; the sile ain't rich enough
for 'em."</p>

<p>Here the chap bust out a larfing, and haw-hawed till it seemed
as if he'd go right off the handle. He tried to choke in, but
that only made him top off short with a touch of the hooping-cough.
Arter a while he wiped his eyes, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Slick! very good indeed! But of course
you accept the Elssler's invitation to the theatre to-night!"</p>

<p>"To the theatre," sez I, "so she goes off there, does she;
well, a feller may see the fun without bidding, so mebby I'll
go."</p>

<p>"Jest inquire for the Astor House box, and it'll be all right,"
sez the chap, and with that he took up the thick paper, and,
sez he,</p>

<p>"How neatly they do turn off these compliments in French,
don't they?"</p>

<p>"In what?" sez I.</p>

<p>"In French," sez he.</p>

<p>"Oh!" sez I, and more and more I was anxious to find out
what the French gal had writ to me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196] </a></span></p>
<p>"How beautifully she's turned this sentence about your
talents," sez he.</p>

<p>"Yes," sez I, all of a twitter inside, but cool as a cucumber
for what he knew. "Yes, purty well, considering, but look a
here now, I'll bet a cookey you can't turn that into fust rate
English as soon as I can, and I'll give you the fust chance
tu."</p>

<p>The chap larfed agin, and sez he, "If you'd a said fust rate
Yankee I should a gin right up tu once, but I ruther think I can
cum up to you in English."</p>

<p>"The proof of the pudding is in eating the bag," sez I.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez he, "I can but try;" so he looked at the paper,
and read it off jest as easy as git out.</p>

<p>"Miss Elssler's compliments to Mr. Jonathan Slick, and hopes
that he will do her the honor to accept a seat in a private box
at the theatre this evening, where she performs in Nathalie and
the Cachuka." Then he went on with a grist of the softest
sodder that ever you heard on, about my talents and genius, and
the cute way I had of writing about the gals, that put me all in
a twitteration; but he read so fast that I couldn't ketch only
now and then a word sartin enough to write it down, and if
I could it would make me feel awful sheepish to think Judy
White would ever see it, so the least said, the soonest
mended.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, sort of condescending, when the chap had got
through, "I give up beat&mdash;you've done it as cute as a razor. I
raly could a parsed the words as you went along. Mebby you
might have tucked in a few more long words, but all things considered,
it aint best to be critical, so I guess I may as well agree
to owe you the cookey." With that I went to my room agin.</p>

the "Brother Jonathan" Newspaper&mdash;Explains his Absence, and
enters into a new Agreement with the Editors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Arter I'd made a visit to Miss Elssler, I went up to my room,
as I was a telling you, and begun to think over what we'd been
a talking about, and it made me feel sort of streaked to think she
took me for one of the Editors of the <i>Express</i>, when I was eenamost
scared to death for fear they wouldn't print my letters agin,
arter I give them the mitten so slick, and went off to Weathersfield.
I didn't suppose the critters ever knew what it was to be
humsick, as I was in this tarnal place, and was afeard they might
rise right up agin having anything to do with me. But think
sez I, there's nothing like keeping a stiff upper lip, and putting
on airs of independence, and talking right up to these newspaper
chaps; so I on with my hat, and cut along towards the
<i>Express</i> Office, detarmined to du up my chores in that quarter,
without chawing over the matter any longer.</p>

<p>Wal, I streaked it along about the quickest, like a string of
onions broke loose at the leetle eend. I begun to feel awful anxious
jest as I got in sight of the office, and the feeling made me
slack foot and ketch breath, I can tell you. As I went by the
corner in a sort of a half canter, with my hands in both pockets&mdash;for
I felt kinder ashamed of the streaked mittens marm knit
for me when my yaller gloves wore out, they didn't exactly gibe
with my other fix up&mdash;the people stopped and stared like all
possessed.</p>

<p>"If that aint Mr. Slick!" sez one;&mdash;"Sure enough," sez
another, "so it is." "Didn't I tell you he wasn't dead," sez
another.</p>

<p>With that I shirked up a leetle, and sez I to myself, sez I&mdash;Who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198] </a></span>cares if the Editors of the <i>Express</i> be mad, cause I cut stick
when they wanted to send me off to Washington, when it was
as hot as all natur, and jest planting time. If my letters were
good for any thing, they'll be glad on 'em agin, and if they aint,
why I'll let 'em see that I'm a true born ginuine American, died
in the wool, and that I can up stakes and go hum agin in the old
sloop as independent as a cork screw.</p>

<p>Arter I'd hung about the corner of the office a leetle while, I
got up pluck, and walked right straight ahead into the office. I
begun to feel to hum the minit I opened the door&mdash;every thing
looked so nat'ral. There was the counter, jest like old times,
and the pigeon holes stuck full of newspapers, and a pile of white
printer's paper a lying up in one corner, and there sot the clark,
a rale ginuine cute leetle Yankee; he was a writing on leetle
scraps of brown paper, and a looking as if all creation would
stop if he didn't go ahead.</p>

<p>I jest give a peak in for a minit and streaked it up stairs, to
see if I couldn't find somebody there. I wish you could have
seen how the work hands stared and looked at one another when
I went in, but I didn't stop to say nothing to nobody, but up I
went, through a room chuck full and brimming over with work
hands, and there in a leetle room, about as big as an undersized
calf pen, sot the critter hisself, eenamost buried up in a pile of
newspapers. It raly did my heart good to look at him, he'd
grown so chirk and hearty, it seemed to me as if he must
a fatted up two inches on the ribs since I'd seen him.</p>

<p>"Gracious me," sez I to myself, "I kinder wish I'd stuck to
and tried to tucker it out last year, and mebby I should a had
something to fat up about. Now I wonder what he's a reading
that tickles him so."</p>

<p>Jest as I was a thinking this, the Editor of the <i>Express</i> he
looked up, and see me a standing there, as if I'd been a growing
on that identical spot ever since last summer. Gauly offilus! but
didn't the newspapers fly, when he was sartin who it was. I see
that he was eenamost tickled to death to see me agin.</p>

<p>"I hain't lost my chance here yet," sez I to myself, and so I
walked right straight up to him, and held out my fist, mitten
and all, and sez I&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199] </a></span></p>
<p>"How do you do?"&mdash;jest so.</p>

<p>"Why Mr. Slick," sez he, "where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Right straight from hum," sez I; "but how du you git along
about these times&mdash;every thing going along about straight, I
s'pose."</p>

<p>By this time he seemed to think that there was something
that he ought to git mad about. You'd a thought he'd swollered
a basket of cowcumbers all of a sudden, he looked so frosty.</p>

<p>"Now for it," sez I to myself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick," sez he, a looking as parpendicular as if he'd eat
tenpenny nails for breakfast, and topped off with a young crowbar,
"Mr. Slick, I'm happy to see you in York agin, but what on
arth was the reason that you left us in the lurch about them letters
from Washington?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever have a touch of humsickness?" sez I, a
straightening up and putting my hands in my pockets, till the
tip eend of my nose eenamost come on a level with his'n.</p>

<p>"I ruther think I have," sez he, a hitching up his shoulders.</p>

<p>"And the ager, too?" sez I.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it," sez he, jest a shaking the leastest mite all
over with thinking about it.</p>

<p>"Awful sort of a chilly animal, that ager, ain't it?" sez I.</p>

<p>"Dreadful," sez he.</p>

<p>"Didn't it seem as if you'd have to take up all your bones for
salt and battery on one another, afore they'd keep still?" sez I.</p>

<p>"A most," sez he, a larfing.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I didn't ketch the fever and ager."</p>

<p>"What did you ketch, then?" sez he, sort of impatient.</p>

<p>"Oh, I felt kinder as if I should git it if I didn't go hum and
doctor," sez I.</p>

<p>"But that wasn't quite reason enough for your goin off so,"
sez he.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it?" sez I, "but that wasn't all; I got a letter from
par, and he wrote that marm was ailing, and that he was getting
down in the mouth, and didn't feel very smart himself, and there
wasn't nobody to weed the onions&mdash;only Judy White&mdash;and she
seemed sort of molancholy, and so"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," sez he, a cutting me off short in what I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200] </a></span>was going to say. I guess he took notice how the blood biled
up in my face, for he went right to talking about something else
as nat'ral as could be.</p>

<p>So arter confabulating a spell about things in general, the
Editor of the Express he begun to poke around among the newspapers
agin, and to hitch around as if he'd jest as lief I wasn't
there. I pulled out my mittens, for it was cold enough to snap
a feller's ears off, early as it was. So I put 'em on sort of deliberate,
and begun to smooth up the red and blue fringe on the
top, jest as if I wanted to go, and yet didn't feel in much of a
hurry.</p>

<p>By-am-by I got up, and sez I, "Wal, good-day&mdash;I s'pose it's
about time for me to be a jogging."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry, Mr. Slick," sez he, a fumbling over the
newspapers all the time.</p>

<p>Think sez I, "If you have any notion to print my letters, it's
about time to come up to the scratch tu once;" but he kept on
a reading, and sez I, a sliding back'ards towards the door,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be in such a pucker to go, but I want to stop at
the office of the Brother Jonathan to see Zeke Jones, from our
parts. He's a prime feller, Zeke is; one of them sort of chaps
that make one proud of human natur. We used to be as thick
as three in a bed afore either of us took to literature. I haint
seen him since, but his stories are the clear grain and no chaff,
ginuine all over, and enough to bring the tears into a feller's
eyes once in a while, I can tell you. The critter 'll go right off
the handle when he sees me, he'll be so tickled," sez I, "and I
haint no doubt but he can get the editors of that creation large
paper to print some of my letters for me."</p>

<p>"There," think sez I, "if that don't bring him up to the
trough, fodder or no fodder, I don't know what will."</p>

<p>Sure enough, I hadn't but jest got the words out of my mouth,
when the chap he spoke up like a man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick," sez he, "don't think of sich a thing as writing
for any paper but the New York Express. I can't bear the idee
of it a minit. You raly can't think how bad we felt for fear
you was dead when we didn't git no more letters from you arter
you went to Weathersfield. Now what do you say to staying
in New York and going ahead agin? Supposing you pull off
your mittens and take hold now?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201] </a></span></p>
<p>I seem'd to sort of deliberate a spell, for I didn't want him to
think I come to York a purpose to stay; so arter a while
sez I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wal, I'll think about it. Par is a getting old, but I guess
he'd about as lief do the foddering an help marm about the
chores as not this winter, and mebby Captain Doolittle will
board there and help about when he hives up for the winter.
But I don't jest know how to manage it. I hain't no go-to-meeting
clothes, that are quite up to the notch. The knees of
my dandy trousers bust out the fust time I got down to weed
onions in 'em, and I feel rather unsartin how this new fix of mine
would take the gals' eyes in Broadway."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't stand on trifles Mr. Slick," sez he, "Editors never
do,"&mdash;and with that he took a squint at my trousers, as if he
was mightily tickled with the fit of 'em and wanted to get a
pattern. This sot me in conceit of 'em a leetle.</p>

<p>"A feller might see that with half an eye, any how," sez I.
"But now I come to think of it, this ere suit of go-to-meeting
clothes that I've got on aint to be sneezed at, now, are they?
Marm spun and made them for me afore I cum away from hum.
She cut 'em by my dandy coat and trousers, and got a purty
scrumptious fit. So mebby they'll be jest the thing. Every
body in Weathersfield took to cuttin their clothes arter mine,"
sez I, sort of bragging,&mdash;because, you know, with some folks
it's best to put the best foot for'ard, and pass for all you're
worth, and sometimes for a leetle more, tu.</p>

<p>It's all a mistake for a man to think tu well of himself; but
the experience I've had here in York tells me, that a man, to
make others think well of him, must make the most of himself
and of all his imperfections. "A good outside for the world,
and a good heart within," was one of the best lessons you larned
me, par, when I left Weathersfield for York. So sez I to the
editor, standing as straight as a broomstick, and striking my
hand upon my hat, and then putting both in my pockets, to
appear sort of independent,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202] </a></span></p>
<p>"If you think they'll du, why I don't care if I hitch tackle
with you agin; but if the notion takes me to cut stick for Washington
or Weathersfield some of these days, I ain't sartin but
you'll find me among the missing, but howsomever, I'll give you
a try at a few letters; but I've got my hand out, I can tell you.
Stringing onions and writing letters on genteel society, ain't the
same thing by no sort of means. So now that's all settled, I'm
off like shot off a shovel."</p>

<p>With that I shook hands with the Editor of the Express, and
made tracks for the sloop about the tickledest feller that ever you
did see.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan Visits Mr. Hogg's Garden and gets a Bouquet&mdash;Puzzled
about the propriety of Paying for it&mdash;Purchases a Ribbon, and
starts for the Theatre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>The minit I got to the sloop I took off my coat, for I didn't
seem to hum enough in the Astor House to write there. I sot
down in the cabin, and stretching out my legs on a butter-tub,
I turned up my ristbands and wrote off the letter that I sent you
t'other day on the top of an onion barrel, without stopping once,
I was so tarnationed anxious to let you know how I was a
getting along.</p>

<p>I had to bite off short, for a chap come aboard the sloop with
Captin Doolittle to bargain for the cargo of cider and garden
sarse. I was afeared that they would want to overhaul my
writing desk, and so made myself scarce, and went up to the
Express with the letter stuck loose inside the crown of my hat,
editor fashion.</p>

<p>I left the hull letter with the clark, and axed him where on
arth a chap could git a smashing bunch of posies, if he took a
notion to want sich a thing. He told me to go right straight up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203] </a></span>to Mr. Hogg's, clear up town along the East River, and said that
I'd better git aboard a Harlem car, and it would carry me right
chock agin the spot for a ninepence.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "the expense aint nothing to kill, so I guess I'll
ride."</p>

<p>With that, I got into one of them allfired awk'ard things that
look like a young school-house sot on wheels, and running away
with the scollars stowed inside; and arter shelling out my ninepence,
we sot out up Centre-street, through the Bowery, and all
along shore, till we stopped short nigh agin the Astoria ferry,
clear up town. Arter searching around a little, I found Mr.
Hogg's gardin, and went in. A great, tall, good-natured looking
chap cum up to me as I was a peaking about&mdash;a feller that made
me feel hum-sick in a minit, he looked so much like our folks.</p>

<p>"How do you du?" sez I, "I'm tickled to see you; they told
me that you keep posies about these ere premises, but I don't see
no signs of 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh," sez he, as good as pie, "come this way, and I guess we
can find as many as you want."</p>

<p>"Wal, that'll be a good many, for I'm a hard critter on marygolds
and holly-hocks," sez I, "and I want a smashing heap on
'em."</p>

<p>With that, Mr. Hogg, instead of taking me into a garden, jest
opened the door of a great long, low house, with an allfired great
winder covering the hull roof, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Walk in."</p>

<p>I guess I did walk in, for the house was chuck full of the harnsomest
trees and bushes that I ever sot eyes on, all kivered over
with posies, and smelling so sweet, that a bed of seed onions,
jest as it busts out in a snow-storm of white flowers, aint nothing
compared to it. Didn't I give good long snuffs as I went in!
This idea, to my notion, of posies amongst big trees and bushes,
are like wimmen folks and young ones in the world of human
natur. If they arnt good for something else they
are plaguey harnsome to look at, and the world would be awful
dark and scraggy without them. Some wimmen may be bad
enough and hateful as henbane, but consarn me if I wouldn't
rather love thorn bushes than none at all.</p>

<p>There was one tree that took my eye the minit I went in; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204] </a></span>hung chuck full of great big oranges, and tell me I lie right out,
it there wasn't a swad of white posies a busting out through
the great green leeves in hull handfuls, all around on the same
limbs where the oranges were a growing. Think sez I, this raly
is a ginuine scripture lesson, spring and fall a gitting in love
with each other and hugging together on the same bush; oh,
gracious! how the parfume did pour out from the middle of that
tree! I felt it a steaming up my nose and creeping through my
hair, till I begun to feel as sweet as if I'd been ducked all over in
a kettle full of biled rose leaves.</p>

<p>Mr. Hogg he went along among the great high rows of bushes
sot in a heap, one on top of t'other almost to the glass ruff, with
a good sized jack-knife in his hand, and then he cut and slashed
among the green leaves and red roses, and piled up a bunch of
posies about the quickest! Yet I wasn't satisfied, he didn't seem
to pick out the rale critters, but tucked in the leetle finefied buds
jest as if he couldn't guess what I wanted 'em for.</p>

<p>"Oh, now you git out," sez I, when he handed over a hull
swad of posies done up in a grist of leaves; "you don't mean to
put me off with that ere! why, it aint a flee-bite to what I want.
Come now, hunt up a few hollyhocks, and marygolds, and poppies,
and if you've got a good smashing hidaranger, purple on one side
and yaller on tother, tuck it in the middle."</p>

<p>Mr. Hogg he stood a looking right in my eyes with his mouth
a little open, as if he didn't know what to make of it.</p>

<p>"The season is over for those things," sez he, "and I haint got
one in the hot-house."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "du the best you can, all things considering,
only tuck in the big posies and enough on 'em, for I'm going to
give 'em to a sneezer of a harnsome gal&mdash;so don't be too sparing."</p>

<p>With that M. Hogg sarched out some great red and yaller
posies, with some streaming long blue ones a sticking through
them, and arter a while he handed over something worth while&mdash;a
great smashing bunch of posies as big as a bell-squash choked
in at the neck.</p>

<p>Arter I'd examined the consarn to be sartin that all was shipshape,
I made Mr. Hogg a bow and, sez I,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205] </a></span></p>
<p>"I'm much obliged to you&mdash;if ever you come to Weathersfield
in the summer time, marm will give you jest as many and
be tickled with the chance. She beats all natur at raising these
sort of things."</p>

<p>He looked at me sort of arnest, but yet he didn't seem to be
jest satisfied, and after snapping his thumb across the blade of
his jack-knife a minit, he spoke out, but seemed kinder loth.</p>

<p>"We generally sell our bokays," sez he, arter haming and
hawing a leetle while.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "mebby I shall want one some of these days,
and then I'll give you a call&mdash;but any how I'm obliged to you
for the posies all the same."</p>

<p>I wanted to offer him a fourpence for the trouble of picking
the posies, but he looked so much like a gentleman and a
Weathersfield Deacon, I was scared for fear he'd think I wanted
to impose on him if I offered money. So I made him another
bow, and went off, while he stood a looking arter me as if I'd
been stealin a sheep. I have wished since that I'd offered him
the fourpence, for he kinder seemed to calculate on something
like it. I stopped into a store, and bought a yard of wide yaller
ribbon, and arter tying it round my bunch of posies in a double
bow not, with great long eends a streaming down, I took the
critter in my hand, and cut dirt for the theatre, for it was
a gitting nigh on to dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>The man who keeps the door at the Park Theatre didn't seem
to know me at fust, but the minit I writ out my name the hull
length, and handed it over, curlecues and all, and told him I
wanted the Astor House box, he was as perlite as a basket of
chips. He handed me over to another chap, who took me up
stairs and along a dark entry way, till he ended in a harnsome
leetle pen, all curtained off with red silk, with purty mahogany
frames that slid up and down over a sort of red pulpit cushion
that run round the front side.</p>

<p>The feller he shut me up, and I sot down on one of the chairs
in the box, and took a gineral survey of the theatre. From
where I sot, it looked as if somebody had laid down an allfired
big horse-shoe for a pattern, and then built after it one tier of
seats above another till they got tired of the fun, and topped off
with a young sky all covered over with golden picters and
curlecued work.</p>

<p>There was a consarned great curtain hung down afore the
stage, with a sort of an Injun mound in the middle, and a house
built on top of it. A lot of painted fellers hung about the front
of the curtain, niggers and Injuns, some a setting down and some
a standing up, and looking like human meat-axes gone to sleep.
One feller that was squat down with his back leaned agin a post,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207] </a></span>had something that looked like a bunch of prime onions with
the tops on, stuffed inter his bosom, and he held a kind of a
short handled frying-pan in his hand as if he meant to cook
some and have a smart fry, as soon as he could git tu a fire.</p>

<p>I hadn't sot long when the men begun to stream into the
theatre like all possessed, with a small sprinkling of the feminine
gender, jest enough to take the cuss off and no more.</p>

<p>In less than no time the house was jammed chuck full and
running over, till I raly felt as if it was wicked to keep so much
room all to myself, when the rest was stowed and jammed up
so close that you couldn't a hung up a flax seed edgeways
between 'em, but think sez I, every one for himself&mdash;I know
when I'm well off, and that's enough. So I leaned over the
cushion, and let one hand hang a leetle over the edge, as independent
as if the whole theatre was mine.</p>

<p>By-am-by the curtain begun to roll up, and I'd like to have
larfed right out to see them painted chaps du themselves up and
curl over the roller&mdash;fust their feet doubled up, then their legs
and hips and shoulders&mdash;then the roller took a slice off from the
bottom of the mound, and turights, the hull was twisted up into
a beam, and hitched to the ruff&mdash;goodness gracious knows how,
I don't!</p>

<p>Wal, when the curtain was all rolled up snug, there raly was
a picter worth looking on behind it. There was a great high
mountain with rail fences cutting across it, and bridges and
trees, that made a feller feel oneasy to git into the shade, and
oxen and cows and folks a driving 'em, going along the road,
that run around slantindicular to the top, and there, jest at the
foot of the hill, was a purty leetle house half kivered over with
grape vines and morning glories that made me think of hum till
I could a bust out crying as well as not.</p>

<p>All to once there was a toot horn sounded up among the
rocks, and then&mdash;oh creation! what a grist of harnsome gals cum
a dancing and larfing and hopping down the mountain, all with
curls a flying and posies twisted among 'em, and white frocks
on, and ribbons a streaming out every which way, and <em>sich</em> feet,
I swanny it made me ketch my breath to see 'em a cutting
about under their white petticoats.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208] </a></span></p>
<p>When they got down onto the flat before the house, the way
they cut it down heel and toe, right and left, down outside and
up the middle, was enough to make the York tippes, the darned
lazy coots, ashamed of themselves. It was Down East all over!&mdash;they
put it down about right, with the ginuine Yankee grit.
I felt all in a twitter to git down and shake a toe with them.
It would be worth while to cut a double shuffle among so many
harnsome gals, with a hull pen chuck full of fiddles a reeling off
the music for you. I'll be darned, Par, if I don't believe it would
make the blood streak it through your old veins about the
quickest, if you be a Justice of the Peace and a Deacon of the
Church.</p>

<p>Arter a while a feller cum up that looked just like a tin pedler
out of work&mdash;a sneaking critter with a face like a jack-knife, and
a white hat on turned clear up on the sides till the front and
back was pinted like a butter scoop. He begun stepping about
and making motions with his arms, till the gals cut up the hill
to work agin, like a coop full of chickens scattered by a hen
hawk.</p>

<p>The chap was a strutting about as crank as a woodchuck, when
in come Miss Elssler a hundred times handsomer than she was to
hum, wheeling a wheel-barrow with a churn in it.</p>

<p>Gauly oppalus! but wasn't she a sneezer! The rest wasn't no
more to compare with her than a dandalion is to a cabbage rose.
On she cum a teetering along as genteel as a bobalink in a wheat
lot. She had on a straw hat curled up at the sides that made
her handsome face look so cunning; besides this she wore a sort
of a new fashioned jacket with short sleeves, that showed a pair
of the roundest fattest arms all sort of tapering off to the hand&mdash;a
purty leetle finefied hand as white as curd, and that looked
eenamost as soft too. With the hat on and the jacket you might
have took her for an allfired harnsome boy, but there was no mistake
about the rest. Mary Beebe couldn't raise a bigger bump
than she had on. Arter all, the boys' and gals' clothing pulled
about an even yoke on her. She had on a short petticoat that
showed a purty considerable chunk of understandings, that tapered
off into a pair of feet, that looked as if they couldn't be
hired to keep still on no account. Take her for all, I can't but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209] </a></span>allow, that she was a smasher in the way of beauty, and her
manners were sartinly very genteel.</p>

<p>The minit she cum on, the folks in the theatre begun to stomp,
and yell, and kick up a darned of a fuss; with that she dropped
her wheel-barrow as if it had been a hot potater, and begun to
curchy, and smile, and put that consarned hand agin her heart,
till I begun to ketch breath like a pair of bellerses.</p>

<p>It took nigh upon three minits afore the consarned fellers
would stop their yop; but when they did choke in a leetle, she
ketched up the wheel-barrow and scooted up the mountain with
it, a teetering and sidling along like a young colt when they are
a breaking him to the bit.</p>

<p>The tin pedler chap, he poked on arter, and gin the wheel-barrow
a boost once in a while as chipper as could be. It made
my dander rise to see the chap a hankering arter her so. If she
wanted to take a shine to a Yankee why couldn't she a found a
feller worth a looking at? But sometimes it does seem as if
these gals couldn't tell bran when the bag's open&mdash;the brightest
on 'em. I say nothing, but it seems to me that she might a gin
one peak up to the Astor House box. I guess it would have
made that chap sing small if she had.</p>

<p>Wal, arter all, the critters both came back agin. The gal had
a red ribbon in her hand and she'd lost her straw hat somewhere
in the bushes. It raly did beat all how she tanteralized that he
coot with the ribbon; fust she made as if she'd give it to him,
and jest as he gripped it, away it slipped through his fingers and
she flourished it now on one side his head, and now on t'other,
as if it had been a streak of lightning she was a playing with. It
tickled me eenamost to death to see how darned sheepish the
critter looked when she sort of hovered about him with the ribbon,
now a sticking that tarnal sweet coaxing face into his'n so
pert, and then darnsing off as easy as git out, with the red ribbon
a streaming from her fingers so sarsy.</p>

<p>Oh gracious! I'd a gin something to have been in that feller's
shoes, I swan if I wouldn't a give her a buss right before 'em
all&mdash;I couldn't a help'd it if all creation had been at the door, and
I swan, Par, I believe you'd a up and give her a smack tu if you'd
been by, old as you be. The sight of her tarnal sweet winning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210] </a></span>ways was enough to rile up the blood in a feller's heart, if he was
as old and frosty as Mathusaler's.</p>

<p>I don't wonder that the fellers stomped and clapped their
paws,&mdash;I'm afear'd I let out a young arthquake myself in that
way. I tried to hold in, but it wasn't the leastest might of use.
That gal is like a sky-rocket, she busts right on a feller and takes
away his senses with the blaze. I settled right down like a cabbage
sprout in a hot sun.</p>

<p>Arter a while the gals all come down from the mountain agin,
and begun to cut up their tantrums; then a harnsome man with
a cap and feathers on, and clothes all kivered with silver and
gold and precious stones, come tipping along leading a great
strapping woman as tall as all out-doors, and dressed off in green
like a bull-frog. They went into a leetle sort of a cubby house
with glass winders, and sot down to see the rest dance.</p>

<p>Didn't they cut the dashes though! helter skelter, hurra boys;
they went at it like a flock of sheep at salting time. By-am-by
they all give out, and my gal, Fanny, she stood up with the leetle
Yankee as if she was a going to dance a jig. She'd put on
another petticoat streaked yaller and blue, but insted of running
up and down, the streaks were a foot wide, and run round and
round like the hoops of a barrel. She'd lost her hat, and a swad
of the shineyest black hair that ever I saw on a gal's head was
kinder slicked down on the sides, and twistified up in a knot
behind her harnsome shaped head, and then topped off with a
bunch of red roses and a pink ribbon that hung streaming down
her back about as long as marm ties your cue, Par, when you go
to meeting.</p>

<p>Wal, the leetle chap he begun to dance fust, and I thought I
should a haw-hawed right out to see him strain and exart himself,
while she stood by with her tarnal cunning head stuck a
one side, so tickled, that the tee-hee fairly bust through, and
made her larf sort of easy all over, but he didn't seem to know
that she was a poking fun at him.</p>

<p>When the chap got through, Miss Elssler she jest sidled up as
softly as a snow storm&mdash;gin her foot a twirl, and took a sort of
genteel dive as if she was a going to swim in the air. Oh dear,
didn't she swim, too! It was like a bird on an apple tree limb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211] </a></span>in spring time, or a boy's kite a sailing and ducking to a south
wind. She didn't kick about, and shuffle, and all that, as I've
seen 'em do; nor did she pucker and twist and sidle like the
darned lazy varmints that I've seen among the fashionable big
bugs; but she was as chirk as a bird, as quick as a grasshopper,
and as soft as a mealy potatoe with the skin off.</p>

<p>By-am-by she broke off short, and spread out her hands, and
curchied to the chap sort of sarsy, as if to say, "Beat that if
you can."</p>

<p>Then the feller he tried agin, and then she, turn about, till at
last she let herself off like a fire cracker on the fourth of July.
One foot flew up into the air like a bird's wing, and whiz&mdash;off
she went like a she comet kicked on eend. Then she sort of let
her foot down by degrees, as a hawk folds its wing, and sloped off
easy, a spreading her hands to the feller, and curchying so sarsy,
as much as to say,</p>

<p>"Try and beat that, now du! all over agin if you can."</p>

<p>The critter sneaked off as if he couldn't help it, then the show
went on, all of 'em talking in signs like deaf and dumb folks.
But it would take a week of Sundays to tell you all. To give
you the butt eend, she was married to the harnsome chap that
run off with her; and out she cum all in white, with diamonds
in her hair and on her neck, and her frock shone with 'em like
a snowball bush kivered with dew in the arly summer. Goodness
gracious! wasn't she a beauty without paint or whitewash,
and didn't she dance! The folks stomped and yelled like a pack
of Injuns, when the chap gave her a grip round the waist, and
she stood on one toe with t'other leg stuck out, and her head
twisted toward his bosom, a twittering like a white swan that
would a flown clear off, if the feller hadn't held on like all natur.
It raly seemed as if you could a seen the white feathers a ruffling
up she was so eager to fly away.</p>

<p>Consarn that chap&mdash;darn him to darnation, I say! It made
me riley to see him a holding on her as if there warn't nobody in
creation but himself. I'll be hanged and choked to death if it
wouldn't a done me good to have licked him on the spot. The
mean finefied varmint! It was lucky the curtain went down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212] </a></span>ca-smash as it did. It give me time to kinder think what I was
a doing, or he'd a ketched it.</p>

<p>I'd eenamost forgot about the auction, for arter the Astor
House chap read the card, I begun to think there was some mistake;
but by-am-by out come a queer looking chap, as chirk as
a catydid, and he begun to sing off a lot of men and women folks
to auction.</p>

<p>Think sez I, goodness gracious! if any body but me bids off
that harnsome critter, I shall go off the handle; I sartinly shall.
He'd knocked off an old maid and a widder, and an Irishman,
and was jest a crying up an old bachelor, when I made up my
mind to bid on her any way, if I had to sell the old sloop,
garden sarse and all, to toe the mark.</p>

<p>I knew the sloop and cargo wasn't mine, but that gal had got
into my head, and I didn't seem to know right from wrong. I
forgot Judy White and all the gals on arth for the time being.
The feller kept a singing out and a knocking on 'em off, but I
didn't hear nobody bid, so I s'posed they did it by winking.
They tell me that's the fashion at the big York vendues. At
the very tip eend of the batch, he up and said he'd got the best
one yet for the young men to bid on, a gal jest eighteen, and
then he run on with a lot of soft sodder about her, but I can't
write what he said, I was in such a twitteration. Think sez I,
it's Fanny Elssler as sure as a gun, and I'll be darn'd if any of
them chaps out-wink me, so I got up and bent for'ard clear over
the cushion, and the way I snapped my eyewinkers at the
auctioneer was awful savage I can tell you.</p>

<p>"No more bids," sez he, a histing his fist, "no more bids,&mdash;going!"
Here I winked like all natur. "Going." I snapped
my eyes till they a'most struck fire, and I stuck out my fist to
arms length and my breath seemed to stop short, I was so dreadful
eager. "Gone!" sez the chap, a stepping back and a lifting
his hand as if he didn't care if I shook to death, and then he
made a bow to the folks in ginral, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Yours with one eye out."</p>

<p>I sallied back and clapped my hand to my eye, for at first I
thought mebby it was out, I'd winked so etarnal arnest: but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213] </a></span>there it was, safe and sound, and some etarnal wall-eyed coot
had got that harnsome critter away from me. At first I was
mad enough to bite a tenpenny nail in tu without chawing; then
I began to feel dreadful wamblecropped, and eenamost boo-hooed
out a crying. In the eend I made up my mind that it
was a mean cheat, and that I'd have the gal in spite of all the
one-eyed fellers in all creation; "for," sez I, "it aint the natur
of things that a critter could wink with one eye as fast as I could
with both winkers under full steam," so I jest made up my mind
to look out the auctioneer, and stick up for my rights.</p>

<p>There was another play, but I felt so down in the mouth that I
up and went right straight off in sarch of that auctioneer, but
nobody seemed to understand who I wanted, till, arter wandering
around like a cat in a strange garret ever so long, I asked the
man at the door; and he said the chap had gone hum, but that
he'd be there agin to-morrow night.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I'll come and see him agin, and he'll find out I
aint to be imposed upon if I am from the country."</p>

<p>With that I went back to the Astor House box, jest in time to
see Fanny Elssler, the critter I'd been bidding off, out on the
stage agin.</p>

<p>There she was, all dressed out in yaller silk, with heaps on
heaps of the black shiney lace a streaming over it, a hopping
about and twistifying round like a love-sick yaller-hammer hankering
arter a mate. She had a rattle-box on each hand, and she
gin a rattle at every new twist, and sometimes it was rattle, rattle,
rattle, as swift as lightning, and then twist, twist, twist; now her
head eenamost bumped agin the floor, and the hump on her back
stuck up higher than ever; then her arms went curlecueing over
her head, and the rattle-boxes gin out a whole hail-storm of
noises, and then she'd stick her arms out at full length and sidle
off, dragging her feet along kind of easy, till I raly didn't know
what she was a doing, till I looked on the piece of paper the man
gin me, and saw that she was a doing up a Cachuca; but if it
wasn't dancing, it sartinly was fust cousin to it, or I aint a judge
of cat-fish. But then who knows but Cachuca is French for
dancing? I don't! any how, she sartinly cachukied it off like
all natur, and no mistake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214] </a></span></p>
<p>By-am-by she give her foot a flirt out and her arms a flourish
upwards, and off she was a going like a trout with a fish-hook in
his mouth; but the folks begun to holler and yell, and take on
so, that she had to cum back whether or no.</p>

<p>She cum back sort of modest, a curchying and a smiling, and
looking so consarned harnsome and mealy-mouthed, that I
thought the men would bust the ruff right off from the theatre,
they stomped and yelled, and made such darned coots of themselves.
All to once, down cum a hull baking of posies, all around
her, as thick as hops. But there wasn't none of them a priming
to the one I had stuffed, stem downwards, in the crown of my
hat.</p>

<p>I jumped up, and gripped the consarn with both hands, and
when the rest had got through, I drew back both hands with a
jerk, and it whizzed downwards with the yaller ribbons a streaming
out, right over the row of lamps, and the pen full of fiddlers,
till it fell ca-swash right down to Miss Elssler's feet.</p>

<p>Gauly offilus! didn't she give a jump! and didn't the folks in
the theatre set up another pow-wow, that a'most lifted the ruff
off the theatre! The chaps seemed to have a notion what a
bunch of posies ought to be when mine cum down amongst the
mean leetle bunches that they'd been a throwing, and sent them
a streaming every which way.</p>

<p>Miss Elssler, arter the fust jump, looked tickled a'most to death
to see such a whopper a lying there, so tempting and sweet; and
I rather guess she took a squint, and sent one of her tarnal killing
smiles towards a good looking sort of a chap, about my size, that
sot with a checkered vest on a leaning over the Astor House box.
I say nothing, but Jonathan Slick haint been to husking balls and
apple cuts ever since he was knee high to a toad, without knowing
the cut of a gal's looks when she's taken a shine to you, or
wants you to see her hum.</p>

<p>I gin her a sort of a knowing squint and a half bow, jest to let
her see that she needn't feel uneasy for fear that I shouldn't toe
the mark; and then I sot still, but awful impatient, till a chap
cum in and picked up a hull armful of the posies. He had to git
down on one of his marrow bones and boost hard at the whopper
that I flung; and when Miss Elssler took 'em all in her arms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215] </a></span>and curchied over and over agin, that bunch of mine lay right
agin her bosom, and spread out so as a'most to kiver her harnsome
white neck. Jest as she was a going off on one side, she
gin another of her tarnal sweet squints up to where I sot, and
then stuck that harnsome face of her'n down into my posey so
tantalizing, I swan, I couldn't stand it no longer, but up I got,
and in less than no time I coaxed the door-keeper to show me
the way back of the theatre, where the critter was.</p>

<p>The chap took me along that entry way, up stairs by the
Astor House box, and through a leetle narrow door, and there he
left me on the top of a lot of stairs that looked as if they'd take
me down into sumbody's cellar. Sich a tarnal, dark, pokerish set
of things I never did see, that's a fact. But I'd got the steam up,
and there aint no whoa to me at sich times,&mdash;so down I went,
hickle-te-picklety, head fust among the paint-pots and boards,
and slabs, and smoky lamps, and arter wandering around like the
babes in the woods, I cum ca-smash right into a room chuck full
of the darncing gals that I'd been half in love with all the
evening.</p>

<p>Oh gracious! it made me sick to think what a tarnal coot I'd
been a making of myself. Some of the critters that I'd thought
so darned harnsome were as old as the hills, and as homely as a
sassafras root, close tu. The paint and white-wash was an inch
thick on some of their faces, and most on 'em were a cutting about
the room as awk'ard as a flock of sheep jest arter shearing time&mdash;and
these were the light purty critters that had a'most drove
me off the handle, they looked so harnsome and taking a leetle
way off. I swow, but it a'most sot me agin all the feminine
gender to think I'd made such a shote of myself as to take such
a shine to them as I had.</p>

<p>The room was chock full of folks. There were old men and
young ones, and all sorts of critters dressed off jest as I'd seen
'em in the play; but they didn't look no more like the same critters,
close to 'em, than chalk's like a new milk's cheese. That
darn'd leetle Yankee chap was there, and while I was considering
whether it was best to scrape acquaintance or not, the identical
auctioneer that had knocked off the old maids and widders,
and Fanny Elssler into the bargain, stood right agin me. I felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216] </a></span>my dander rise the minit I sot eyes on him, so I went up to the
Yankee chap, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can't tell me who that chap is, can you?"</p>

<p>The Yankee looked round, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that's Billy Williams, a good hearted comical chap as
ever lived. Don't you know him sir? I thought every body
knew Billy Williams."</p>

<p>"I don't know jest yet, but I guess I shall afore long," sez I,
a looking pitchforks and hatchel teeth at the auctioneer, and with
that I walked right straight up to him, with my hands dug down
into my trousers' pockets, as savage as could be, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"How do you du sir? I'll jest speak a few words to you, if
you haint no objection."</p>

<p>"Sartinly," sez he, as easy as all natur, and with that he got
up and walked out of the room, and I arter him, till we cum out
onto a sort of an etarnal big barn floor that was shut out from
the rest of the Theatre, by that whopping curtain that I'd seen
the t'other side on it. There was a hull regiment of empty hay
lofts&mdash;or what looked jest like 'em, great naked rafters and posts,
with rows of smoky lamps stuck on 'em, and what looked like
pieces of board fence daubed over with all sorts of paint, and the
wind come a whistling and croaking among them all, till my
teeth a'most begun to chatter in my head.</p>

<p>I was so busy a wondering what on arth those awful dismal
premises could be used for, that I forgot the auctioneer, till he
turned round as good natured as a sucking pig, and asked what I
wanted of him.</p>

<p>"Look a here," sez I, as wrothy as could be for the cold, "I
want the gal that I bid off in the Theatre to-night, so you jest
hand over and save trouble, that's all."</p>

<p>The feller he stared at me like a stuck pig, and then he bust
right out a larfing in my face as if he meant to make fun of it
all, but he'd got hold of the wrong chicken for that sort of corn,
and I give him to understand as much afore he'd done with me.</p>

<p>"Now," sez I, "look a here. It aint of no use for you to try
to bamboozle me with your haw-hawing. I want the gal that
I bid off&mdash;I don't care how much the charge is. I'll hand over
the chink the minit you'll go to one of them pesky lawyers and
git the deed drawn out. I'm sartin that I outwinked every chap
in the theatre, and darn me if I give up to any of em."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217] </a></span></p>
<p>He stared at fust like a calf's head jest dressed, and then he
bust out a larfin, till I was mad enough to kick him on eend till he
flew up into one of the empty hay lofts.</p>

<p>"Come," sez I, "do you mean to toe the mark or not? I'm
getting awful tingley about the fingers eends, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Now," sez he, a sobering down a leetle, "did you take me
for an auctioneer, in rale arnest?"</p>

<p>I began to feel sort of unsartin what to say, and instead of
speaking right out, I circumnavigated a leetle, for a sort of a
notion cum over me, that mebby, arter all, it wasn't nothing but
make-believe, and that I was jest on the point of making a consarned
coot of myself.</p>

<p>"Wal, now, you did it up as cute as a razor, didn't you?" sez
I. "It was eenamost enough to make a feller think that you
was in arnest, wasn't it? but then I aint quite sich a green horn
as some chaps that come from the country, and know what's
what. I haint seen anything that tickled me so much as that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Comic song," sez he.</p>

<p>"Oh," sez I, as quick as wink, "you needn't take a feller up
afore he's down. I was jest a going to say that you raly are a
sneezer at saying over them comic songs, and sartinly you do
look as nat'ral as life. In course I knew there warn't no wall-eyed
critter a bidding, and thought I'd jest see if you was as
cute a looking critter close to. More than that, I've got a notion
to take a peak at the fixins back of the curtain close tu&mdash;so
s'posing you and I jest walk among them hills, and housen, and
trees, that looked so plaguey cool and shady."</p>

<p>I kept on a talking so that he needn't see how tarnal sheepish
I felt, arter making sich a coot of myself as to believe he'd sold
Miss Elssler in rale arnest.</p>

<p>"Why," sez he, as good natured as could be, "here you are,
right in the midst of all the trees and hills and houses that you
saw in front."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, you git out!" sez I, "I aint green enough to swaller
that, any how."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218] </a></span></p>
<p>He looked round at a pile of old wooden partitions, daubed
over with paint, and a standing edgeways, and sort of slantindicular,
under the naked rafters and hay lofts, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm in arnest now&mdash;this is all the scenery that you saw from
the front. You stand on the stage, jest back of where I sung my
comic song, and that is the curtain."</p>

<p>"What, that old sloop sail?" sez I. "How you du talk! I
sniggers, but I can't believe it."</p>

<p>"Jest go to the curtain and look through the edge there," sez
he.</p>

<p>And with that he went with me, and pulled back the edge of
the curtain, and I gin a sudden peak through. Sure enough, the
theatre was right before me, chuck full of folks, jest as I'd left it;
and the pen full of fiddlers, was a streaming out the music right
under my nose, till I couldn't hear myself think. When I turned
round agin, and see how awful dark and chilly every thing looked,
and found myself wandering with Mr. Williams among a hull
univarse of posts, and boards, and lamps, and painted cloth, I felt
chilled through and through, as if I'd got ketched in a rain storm,
and had found kiver in a saw mill. Nothing but a rickety old
barn, or a lot full of white pine stumps, could look half so dismal.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "if this is the theatre, I pity the poor critters
that's got to get a living in it, any how."</p>

<p>"It's bad enuf," sez Mr. Williams, a twistifying up his face sort
of comical, and yit looking as if he'd bust out a crying if you
said two words more, "its bad enuf, but then we put the best
side out."</p>

<p>"I should think you did," sez I, a looking round; but jest that
minit I got a squint at a gal, a streaking it through the posts and
boards, all kivered over with a cloak, but there warn't no cheating
me in the critter. I knew in the dark who it was&mdash;nobody
on arth but Miss Elssler could walk so teaterish. My heart riz
in my mouth, and without stopping to say goodnight, I cut away
from Mr. Williams and pulled foot after her like all possessed.
She was jest a going out of a dark entryway that led out doors,
when I ketched up with her.</p>

<p>"How do you du, Miss Elssler?" sez I, all in a twitter, "shall
I have the pleasure to see you hum?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219] </a></span></p>
<p>With that I crooked my right elbow and looked right straight
down into the darndest consarned, harnsomest pair of eyes, as
arnest as could be, for I was awfully afeard of gitting the mitten;
but she looked up and see who it was a standing there, with the
blood a biling up into his face, and a trembling all over, he was
so arnest; and then she up and give me one of them tantalizing
smiles of her'n, and sez she, as nat'ral as life, sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Slick, I am so pleased to see you again," and with
that she laid them purty white fingers of her'n on my coat sleeve
jest as if I had been her twin brother. Gracious goodness! how
the blood did tingle and cut about up my arm, and all around the
vicinity of my life engine, the minit that etarnal purty leetle hand
touched my arm; but when I helped her down them dark steps,
and had to put my arm kinder round her waist to keep her from
slipping up, I never did feel so all overish in my hull life. It
seemed as if I could a danced on one toe with her to all eternity,
and never felt a hungry nor a dry. There was a coach stood close
to the steps right by the back door of the theatre, and a feller
stood by it a holding the door open. Miss Elssler kinder staggered
a trifle as I went to help her in, so I lent her the leetlest mite of
a genteel boost and got in arter her, jest as if I was tu hum. The
inside of the carriage was chuck full of posies, and there I sot
right in the middle on 'em, with that consarned harnsome critter
a smiling and a talking her soft sodder right in my face till I got
to the Astor House. Gaully offilus! wasn't I as happy as a bee
on a red clover top! You don't know nothing about it, Par.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan gets out of love with Fanny Elssler&mdash;Doctors the Ague in
her Face and Leaves her&mdash;Receives an Invitation from his Pussey
Cousin to a Thanksgiving Dinner, with a three cornered Note for
Lord Morpeth&mdash;Jonathan's Opinion of the Travelling Lords and
Democratic Hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>When I'd seen Miss Elssler hum arter the Theatre, I couldn't
shut my eyes all night a thinking about her. She seems to get
into a critter's head like a glass of Cousin Beebe's cider, and
dances about there till everything else is kicked out. Her harnsome
face seemed to be a bending over mine and smiling into my
eyes through the dark all night, and if it was to save my life, I
couldn't get a wink of sleep. Sometimes it seemed as if she was
a whirling round and round with one toe on the bed post, a
spreading out her hands so tempting, and flying about jest at my
feet. Then again it seemed to me as if she was a standing in a
corner of the room and holding her finger up jest to tantalize me,
larfing in her sweet, cunning way, and a cutting up all sorts of
tantrims, jest to keep me awake all night. I got up arly in the
morning, but it wasn't of the leastest mite of use my trying to do
anything but think of that consarned critter; so arter trying to
write a letter without making out anything for two hull hours,
I slicked up and went down to Miss Elssler's room detarmined to
give up to once, and not try any more, but jest stay with her till
it was time to go to the sloop, and take a cold cut as we'd agreed
on.</p>

<p>I felt in a tarnation twitter, for all she'd asked me to cum; but
I knocked at the door and walked straight in as if I'd been tu
hum. Miss Elssler was a half lying on that settee that I wrote
to you about; her head was boosted up with pillows and cushions
with tossels to the arms, and them consarned leetle feet of
hern jest peaked out from under a great red shawl that she'd flung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221] </a></span>over 'em. She ris up sort of quick as I cum in, and kinder tried to
smile, but oh! gracious, how her face looked! I cut right off short
with a jerk in the bow I was a making, and stared at her with
all the eyes I'd got in my head. She'd got the ager, and that
harnsome face of hern was puckered and twistified up till it looked
as if she'd been fed on crab-apples for a whole month.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were swelled a trifle and as red as a piney, and her
eyes kinder sunk in till you couldn't but jest see 'em twinkle, and
when she started herself to larf, her mouth tipped up at one corner
and down at t'other, till it cut across her face slantindic'lar,
and made her look all one side every time she squinched her face.
I swow, but it made me feel wamblecropped to see her; I begun
to think there wasn't much chance for a cold bite aboard the
sloop that day, but think sez I, there's no harm in doctoring any
how. So I thought over all the cures marm has for the ager, and
arter calling a waiter, I told him to bring up about a peck of hops
biling hot with vinegar.</p>

<p>When the chap cum back, I tied a hull swad of 'em in a pink
silk long shawl that I found a lying on a chair, and crossed them
over the critter's face, and tied the shawl in a double bow knot
on the top of her head; but the hops were rather hot I reckon,
and she squalled out like all natur till I took 'em off, and sent the
waiter off for a ginger plaster and a bag of hot ashes. Arter
she'd tried them a few minits, they seemed to mollify the ager
quite considerable; but as the pain went off, her face begun to
swell and puff up, like a baking of bread wet up with turnpike
emptins, and I see that there warn't no chance left of her going
to Captin Doolittle's cold bite, nor nowhere else for a long
spell.</p>

<p>By-am-by that old maid, that I'd seen before, she cum in, and
begun too look pitchforks and darning-needles at me, as if she
thought my room was as good as my company, so I up and went
off, jest stopping to make a leetle chunk of a bow at the door, to
let the old maid see I hadn't forgot my manners if she had.</p>

<p>I cut for my room, feeling a leetle streaked to think how I'd
been a follering round arter Miss Elssler. I'd been a hankering
arter that critter for nothing on arth but her harnsome face and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222] </a></span>finefied manners, when a trifle of cold could transmogrify it so
tarnally. It made me feel cheap, and I couldn't help it.</p>

<p>Marm al'rs said that harb tea was a cure all, but raly I never
should a thought of taking it to get rid of a lovesick fit, and arter
all I'm afeared that Miss Elssler's face will git cured up afore I
git over the tantrum it's sot me into.</p>

<p>Wal, when I'd got to my room agin, there was a letter on
the mantle shelf, sealed with a great whopping bunch of wax, and
stomped down with a round "O," as big as a cent, with a rooster
stuck right in the middle of it. I broke the consarn open,
and found out it was an invite to Thanksgiving Dinner to Cousin
Jason Slick's. Arter writing a hull page of soft sodder, the
pussy coot let the cat out of the bag. There's an English lord a
putting up here, and he wanted me to ask him up to his house to
dinner, and said Lord Morpeth would sartinly come if I asked
him, because we were both kinder of literary together.</p>

<p>Now, if there's anything on arth that I despise, it's a genuine
true born Yankee a hankering arter the big-bug lords that come
over here, on'y jest because they've got a long tail to their names.
For my part, I haint no idee of demeaning myself in that way
anyhow. If a lord behaves himself like folks, he's as good as a
Yankee any day; and he ought to be treated jest as well, and I
don't think the most ginuine republican amongst us ought to be
ashamed to ask him to take pot luck or a glass of drink, if he
likes it.</p>

<p>As long as they treat us according to gunter, when we go to
see them on t'other side of the water, it is no more than the fair
thing if we take turn about, and do the genteel by them a trifle.
We ought to feel streaked with all our lands and barns full of
grain, if we can't give a foreign chap something to eat and drink
without grudging on it, and then agin, without being tickled
to death because they don't feel too much pomposity to eat it.</p>

<p>Jason had sent a leetle finefied letter inside of mine, doubled
over and twisted up at the corners like an old fashioned cocked
hat, and smelling as sweet as a garden pink root in full blow. It
was directed in leetle finefied writing to His Highness the Right
Honorable Lord Morpeth&mdash;Howard Member of Parliament, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223] </a></span>Think sez I, this English chap needn't be consarned that
his kite wont sail high among the Yankees for want of a long
tail to it, if they all tuck the etceteras onto his name so strong
as cousin Jase does.</p>

<p>But I hadn't no idee of being waiter to my pussy cousin, anyhow.
If Jase has a mind to send his invite to a lord, done up
like a cocked hat, let him be his own nigger, or else send it by the
post-office&mdash;I wasn't a going to do it for him nor touch it. No
lord that is any great shakes will think the better of an honest
Republican for acting as if he was scared to ask him to eat dinner,
or tickled to death if he didn't feel tu much stuck up to come
with plain Yankee asking.</p>

<p>I made up my mind, that if Lord Morpeth took a notion to
eat Thanksgiving with Jase, he'd be jest as likely to get his paper
cocked hat from the Post Office, as anywhere. So, as I was a
going through the Park, I took the consarn between my thumb
and finger, for fear of siling it, and tucked it through a slit in the
post office, made a purpose for city letters; and off I went, a
tickling myself eenamost to death, with thinking how the post
office clarks would giggle and stare, and snuff up their noses to
see such a pinted critter directed to a Lord, and a smelling so
sweet, with a long tail of names curled up in all the corners,&mdash;and
Lord Morpeth, tu, wouldn't he set our Jase down for a
shaller pated coot? I've a kind of a sneaking notion that it's as
like as not he would, but that's none of my bisness. In this country,
a feller aint to blame for his relations, that's one comfort.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Description of Cousin Jason's Equipage&mdash;Figure cut by Mrs. Jason

creates great Consternation by proclaiming the Head of the Family
as a Shoemaker&mdash;Makes a Speech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>Wal, next day was Thanksgiving, and down come another letter
to say that Lord Morpeth was a coming, and that Jase was a
going to send down his span fired new carriage to the Astor
House, arter Lord Morpeth and I, afore dinner time; and he gin
me to understand, that if I could keep the carriage a spell afore
the Astor House steps, where folks could get a chance to see the
new fixings and horses, there wouldn't be no harm done to
nobody,&mdash;the darned mean pussy coot! When a feller tries to
make me do a mean thing I'm awful ugly, my Yankee grit is up
in a jiffy, and I'm jest like a skeery horse that al'rs backs up hill
when you want to lead him down.</p>

<p>Afore this I'd been on a cyphering voyage through my purse
to see if I couldn't afford to go down to Lynde &amp; Jennings' and
bye a new narrow collar'd coat and some other dandy consarns,
seeing I was a going to dine with a Lord; but when this letter
cum I detarmined to go in the old fix up, jest to let this Lord and
my pussy cousin see a ginuine Yankee that wasn't ashamed of
hisself in a homespun coat and trousers.</p>

<p>Howsomever I gin myself a purty good sudsing, and shaved as
close as a Wall street broker; besides I did some extra fixing to
my collar and hair, and paired off my finger-nails harnsomely, and
scrubbed the yaller from off my teeth with the corner of a brown
towel that I found in my saddle-bags; for there aint no reason
that I know on, why a true born American shouldn't wash up
and keep a clean face and a stiff upper lip, if he does weed his
own onions and wear a humspun coat. A chap may live in a land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225] </a></span>of Liberty and let these lords know it tu, without swellin like a
toad to outshine the British, or going slouching about as if we
put a tax on soap and water, jest as they do on winder glass.</p>

<p>For my part, I didn't mean to let Lord Morpeth think that we
give so much soft soap here in York without keeping enough to
wash our own faces on thanksgiving day.</p>

<p>When I was fixed up about tu the right noch, down stairs I
went, with the eend of my checkered silk neck-hankercher a
tucked under my streaked vest, my hair slicked down on both
sides, my face a shining like a new pin, and my boots blacked up
till they glistened like a gal's eye.</p>

<p>I tucked up my yaller silk hankercher clear into my coat
pocket, for I didn't feel like showing all out to once, and I put my
new mittens on sort a careless, and streaked the blue and red
fringe up as I went down the Astor House steps through a
double row of dandies that had swarmed out of the stun hall
above to see my pussey cousin's carriage and horses that stood a
glistening jest afore the house.</p>

<p>There the carriage stood right in Broadway, about the dashingest
consarn that ever I sot eyes on. The wheels were a good
ways apart and black as a minister's coat, and a great harnsome
box swung over 'em, shut up tight, and a glistening in the sun till
it a'most blinded a feller's eye-sight to look on it. There was a
door on each side as big as them in the pulpit of our meeting
house, with a whopping square of glass in the top and bottom all
figgered off with gold, and then crouchonts, and lions, and
roosters all pictered out in gold tu, and looking as nat'ral as life,
for all they were so yaller and jammed down in a heap till it
seemed as if the lions would roar right out, and the rooster give
a coo-co-doo-dle-do if any body went tu tuch them.</p>

<p>Behind the hull consarn, was a great wide flat stair, with two
pussy fellers a standing on it,&mdash;each on 'em holding to a yaller
tossel fixed tight to the coach and dressed out like folks in the
theatre, with great high boots, and topped off with a wide rim
of white, wide white cuffs to their coats, and white ribbons and
beaus twisted round their hats.</p>

<p>Right in front was a seat with a great square cushion on it,
and all hung off with the finest kind of boughten cloth and piles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226] </a></span>of heavy yaller fringe, with the golden lions, and crouchants, and
roosters pictered out and a glistening among the folds, till it
a'most outshined the sun&mdash;and that was purty bright for November.</p>

<p>A tall feller dressed out like the chaps behind, sot on this heap
of gimcracks with a great long whip stuck up by his elbow, and
a holding in two tremendous harnsome black horses that stood
hitched to the carriage, under a hull net of black shiney leather,
golden buckles, and deers' heads cut out in chunks of gold, and
sot on to the blinder, and saddle-trees, and every place an inch
square that they could be poked in.</p>

<p>If there is a critter on arth that I take tu, it's a good horse,
and I couldn't help but be proud of them smashing arnimals as
they shook their heads up so sarsy, as if the sun hadn't no business
in their great eyes that had fire enough in 'em without its
help, and pawed on the ground with their fore-feet&mdash;the mettlesome
varmints!&mdash;like a couple of harnsome women, chuck full
of music and crazy to dance it off.</p>

<p>When the chaps saw me a coming down the Astor House
steps, one of 'em jumped down and opened the door and let out
a hull grist of steps down to the ground, all kivered over with
the brightest kind of carpet, till it looked as if somebody had
been a flinging hull baskets full of posies all over 'em for me to
stomp down with my shiney boots, if I wanted tu.</p>

<p>Jest as I was a thinking whether it was best for Lord Morpeth
to come before I got in myself&mdash;for I didn't want to du nothing
that wasn't according to gunter, if he was a lord&mdash;a feller come
down the Astor House steps dressed off to the nines, with a harnsome
cloak slung across his shoulder, and one side of his hat
tipped up jest enough to show a hull swad of curly hair a frizzling
round his ears.</p>

<p>He had a leetle dab of hair a curling jest under his nose, and
another leetle peaked consarn up in a pint from his chin.</p>

<p>When this chap come down the steps, the other varmint that
stood behind the carriage in his white topped stompers give a
dive to the arth, and stood a one side the door which t'other one
held open. Think sez I, this is Lord Morpeth as sure as a gun;
so I haul'd back my foot from the fust step, for I was jest a going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227] </a></span>to get in, and I stepped back as the chap come up, and arter
making him a half bow&mdash;for I never give off the extra touches
in a bow only to the harnsome gals&mdash;sez I,</p>

<p>"Walk in, Lord Morpeth, and I'll foller arter."</p>

<p>The feller looked at me sort of supercillious, and I could see
the dab of hair on his lip curl the leastest mite scornful as if he
smelt something that didn't agree with him. He didn't make a
bow, but stepped back as if he didn't jest know what to du.</p>

<p>I give my mitten a short flourish towards my hat, and arter
stepping back agin, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arter you is manners for me. Make yourself to hum, Lord
Morpeth."</p>

<p>The chap looked at me agin, and then he went close to the
feller that held the door, and said that Lord Morpeth couldn't go
jest yit, but that we'd better go on and he'd come by-am-by;
and with that he went up the steps agin without as much as
saying, git out, to me.</p>

<p>Gawrie, but wasn't I wrothy to see that crowd of York dandies
see me slighted so by a lord. There they stood a puckering up
their faces like monkeys in a show, and there I stood feeling as
mean as the meanest among 'em; but arter a minit my dander
ris right up.</p>

<p>"Darn the critter," sez I, a'most out loud, and a pulling my
mitten up so wrothy that a whole swad of frieze gin away in my
hand. "Does the stuck up varmint feel above riding with an
honest Yankee, because he haint got no title? I'll be licked if
a lord ever gets a speck of good manners from me agin, consarn
the hull biling on 'em."</p>

<p>With that I gin an allfired jump, and settled down in the carriage,
as savage as a young arthquake, and sot down on one of
the harnsome cushions kivered over with silks and figgered off
with blue and white roses, that kivered the two seats and sort
of sprangled up over the sides and ruff of the carriage. A narrow
finefied border squirmed all around the cushions, around the
doors, and into all the corners, and the hull consarn made a chap
feel as if he was shut up in a band-box, lined with silk and with
a chunk of the sky, white clouds and all, shut over him for a lid.</p>

<p>I was so allfired wrothy, that, without thinking on it, I histed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228] </a></span>my boots agin one of the cushions, jest as it's nat'ral tu, when a
feller's so mad he can't help it, and left a purty considerable
smooch of blacking amongst the blue and white posies, that sot
them off ruther more than cousin Jase would like, I calculate.</p>

<p>Them carriages do cut dirt so soft and easy like a streak of
greased lightning, that there is no knowing how fast a feller gets
along. It didn't seem more than a half a jiffy when we drew up
co-wallop right afore Jase's house. Down got the two varmints
in white topped stompers, open went the door, and out I jumped.</p>

<p>I didn't have to ring at the silver knob, but the door swung
open of itself, or seemed tu, and in I poked, as independent as a
clam in high water, but not afore I'd ketched a squint at that
shaller little Jemima, a peaking out from behind the winder curtains
to see who was coming with me.</p>

<p>A chap took my hat and things in the entry way, and asked
me what my name was, sort of low, as if it was something I
ought to be ashamed of; and the minnit I told him, he went to
the door of the keeping-room and bawled out,</p>

<p>"Mr. Jonathan Slick."</p>

<p>I went in and there sot our Jase, in a great armed chair, as
red and pussy as a turkey-gobbler, jest afore Christmas. He got
up and come for'ard, but looked nation wamblecropped when he
see that there wasn't nobody with me. That wife of his'n cum
up with her fat hands stuck out, and asked how I was, and why
Lord Morpeth didn't cum, and Jemima, she stood a giggling
worse than ever, and a tossing them yaller curls of her'n about
on her shoulders and cousined me off to kill.</p>

<p>I told Jase how Lord Morpeth had sarved me, but he didn't
seem to mind that, arter he found out that he was a coming by-am-by,
so we sot down. I took a sort of a survey of the premises.
Now if there is anything that makes me mad, it's to see a chap
a selling off his harnsome things when they git a little siled or
out of fashion. I couldn't no more sell a cheer or a table that
any of my friends had eat off from, or sot on, than I would
strike my granny. Jest think how you'd feel to see grand par
Slick's arm'd chair sold at Vandue, or the chest o' drawers that
marm kept her "leetle things" in when I was a baby bought in
by the neighbors. It makes me feel wamblecropped only jest to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229] </a></span>think of it, and yet there wasn't a single thing in the two great
rooms that I went into at Cousin Jase's, that had a place where
it was the last time I was there. Everything looked spick-span
new, and I haint no doubt that the hull house had been
transmogrified and titivated up jest cause a Lord was coming
to eat dinner there. The carpets were a'most all red, with a
vine of pink and yaller a running crinkle-crankle all over 'em as
if somebody had been a scattering a hat full of butter-cups and
meadow pinks all over it, the whole consarn giving under your
feet like a flat meadow lot thick with a fall arter growth.</p>

<p>Great smashing looking-glasses were set into the wall from
top to bottom between the winders, and a hull dry-goods store
of red silk curtains sot off with yaller bordering, fell in great
heavy winrows from over a couple of long spikes, feathered off
at the eend, and a glistening with gold, kivered both ends of the
room all but the looking-glasses and winders. A whopping
great picter of Jase a setting in his easy chair, and reading a
book, kivered with velvet and gold, was hung over one mantle-tree
shelf, and over t'other sot his wife, all feathers and flowers,
and silks and satins, with her red pussy face a shining among
the whole, and all pen'd up in a gold frame, as wide as a slab,
and a glist'ning like all natur.</p>

<p>Cousin Jase had gone into the fine arts to kill, arter he got
hopes of a Lord. There was Jemima's shaller head cut out
in marble, a kind of half swarry, with stun curls a hanging like
icicles down her back, and a stun post to stand on, a rolling up
its eyes to a corner of the room; and there were two funny sort
of women, with wings that looked as if they'd been made of gold
at fust, and then touched off with a thin coat of blacking, that
made a sort of amalgamation critters, black and gold, stood each
side of the looking-glasses, a holding back the silk curtains that
would have fell ca-swash over the whole eend of the room if it
hadn't been for them; then out on the carpet was tables made out of
black shiny stuff, and the whole round tops kivered over with
picters that seemed as if they were polished down clear into the
black wood, and all around was benches and foot-stools of the
same black wood, sprigged off with gold, and cushioned off with
red silk, besides the settees that had high backs and high arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230] </a></span>at one eend, but curlecued down at the back, tapered off to a
square bench on t'other, and sot out like the stools with thick
red cushions.</p>

<p>Right over the pictered tables was a sort of a golden tree,
chained to the ruff, and kivered over and over with chunks of
glass, that shone like tears in a gal's eye, when she gits the
grit up.</p>

<p>Besides all these, was tu great round silk cushions, as thick as
mother's cheese tub, a sitting right squat on the carpet, and
tassled off to kill, with a mess of other things that I hadn't a
chance to look at afore the door was pushed open by the help
that stood in the hall; and there stood a tall man, with a blue
coat on, and gilt buttons, each on 'em pictered off like our ten
cent pieces, on'y instead of the Eagle, there was a Lion, and
some kind of a one-horned animal, a pawing up hill arter a sort
of a cap with pints to it.</p>

<p>Afore I saw these pictered buttons, I kinder thought the chap
must be Lord Morpeth himself, for he come in sort of softly, and
yit independent, like a feller that felt himself to hum any where,
but yit didn't want to walk over other folks, as them big bug
foreigners al'rs du; but on a second peak I see that it wasn't
the chap that I had seen at the Astor House, and beside that he
was shaved clean, and hadn't a speck of hair, only on his head
and eye-brows, and that was a little mite gray; so, think sez I
to myself, that other chap was the Lord, and this is his waiter,
cum to tell Jase that the big bug has gin up cumin. For no
Lord that can git dye stuff or buy a wig, would ever come a
visiting with gray hairs in his head. You wouldn't ketch one
of our York tippies at that, let alone a ginuine Lord.</p>

<p>I never saw Jase so wrothy as he was when he ketched sight
of the feller, for he got a peak at the buttons the fust thing, and
sez he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"By gracious! if his lordship haint sent word to say he can't
come!"</p>

<p>With that he went to the door, and sez he to the man, sez
he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wal, Sir, did you bring a note for me, or what?"</p>

<p>And then he strutted right in the door-way, as pussy and pompous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231] </a></span>as a prize pig jest afore killing time, and there stood the tall
chap, jest afore him, a looking right into his red face, with a pair
of eyes as black and keen as a weazle's, yit sort of easy and good
natured, as if he couldn't think what the matter was. He took
off his hat sort of easy, and kinder bent his head a leetle, and sez
he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it Mr. Slick?"</p>

<p>He spoke so soft and humble that it seemed to mollify Jase; he
stepped for'ard and waved his hand about as big as cuffy, and sez
he, as condescending as could be, sez he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Put on your hat, my good fellow, I've been a poor man myself.
What word did his lordship send? don't be afeard to speak!"</p>

<p>The chap looked at Jase, and I could see his mouth pucker up
the leastest mite in the world, and his eyes begun to twinkle as
if he'd choked back a smile from his lips that was detarmined to
break through somewhere. He bowed his head a little, and then
he handed over a piece of square pasteboard jest like that Miss
Elssler gave to me.</p>

<p>Didn't my pussy cousin look as if he'd fell through a thin place
in the ice! He wilted right down, and looked as sneaking as a
turkey gobbler ketch'd out in a rainy storm; but when he see
that Lord Morpeth didn't seem to know that he'd mistook him
for a waiter, he walked into the room a spreading his hands
and a sending out a storm of excuses, and welcomes, and friendships,
like a junk bottle of cider letting off steam.</p>

<p>Lord Morpeth, he walked along into the room jest as if he'd
been to hum, and then Jase he spread himself agin, and made him
acquainted with his wife.</p>

<p>Lord Morpeth made a little slow bow, and Mrs. Jase Slick she
gin her turban a toss, spread out the skirts of her velvet frock that
was jest the color of a wild cherry, and then, after sticking out
her fat foot, she began to fold up her jints, till she threatened to
settle down on the carpet all in a heap, before she'd a let out all
her kinks agin. Jemima she come up and begun to flourish out
her foot, and show her curls, and her teeth, and twitter about,
while Lord Morpeth was a bowing to her. I swow, it made me
grit my teeth to see what tarnal coots the whole consarn were a
making of themselves! Then cum my turn. I stood a leaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232] </a></span>agin the mantle-shelf, detarmined to show this Lord that all the
Slicks on arth warn't darned etarnal chuckleheads if some of
them was. I'd a seen him in Guinea and further yet, afore he'd
a got one speck of a bow more than he give me.</p>

<p>Well, Lord Morpeth, he bowed his head rather sparing of his
neck, and I stood right straight up, and gin him as good as he sent,
and no more on it, by hokey; yet there was something about this
critter that took my notion amazingly; he didn't seem stuck up
a bit, nor yet as if he wanted to poke fun at us, but sot down on
one of the curlecued settees, and begun to talk about the weather,
and things in general, jest like our folks. Miss Slick, she sot
down by him, and purty soon let him into the state of things
here in York. She went into a fit of the dreadful suz, to think
Lord Morpeth didn't ride up in the carriage&mdash;it was a dreadful
thing to walk in the streets among the common people&mdash;her
daughter Jemima had once brushed the skirt of her tunic agin a
mechanic, as she went down Broadway, and they felt it their
bounden duty to keep her from walking ever since,&mdash;Jemima was
so delicate, so very literary, so&mdash;here Jemima, who sot on a bench
close by the settee, turned up them eyes of her'n and gin a sigh
that made the pucker come to Lord Morpeth's mouth agin, and
when Miss Slick got up and handed over some varses that she
said Jemima had writ the minit she heard that Lord Morpeth had
come to this country, the tickle burst into his eyes, and he went
to the winder with the paper in his hand, jest as if he wanted to
read it over agin. Miss Slick she stretched up and looked at Jase,
and Jemima, and me, and nodded her head, as much as to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's clenched the business. If Lord Morpeth don't take
a shine to my darter arter reading that, I want to know, that's
all!"</p>

<p>Jase he twirled his great gold watch key, and peaked at Lord
Morpeth from under his eye-brows, and Jemima, she struck her
head a one side and tried to look as if she couldn't help it, till
Lord Morpeth he come back agin from the winder, a looking as
meek as a gray cat with a dab of cream on her whiskers, jest as
if he hadn't been tickling himself to death behind the curtains
there; and I, consarn me, if I didn't feel as mean as a frozen potater,
to think my name was Slick.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233] </a></span></p>
<p>Miss Slick she spread herself out on the settee agin beside Lord
Morpeth, and give him another dose of soft sodder, till I raly felt
sorry for the poor critter. She held up her two chunked hands,
and rolled up her eyes like all natur, when he told her which side
of Broadway he come up; but Lord Morpeth said the west side
was the most crowded, and so he took t'other.</p>

<p>"On'y jest to think, Jemima," sez Miss Slick, "Lord Morpeth
come up on the east side of Broadway, dear me!"</p>

<p>Jemima she lifted up her head, and looked a whole biling of
lasses candy at Lord Morpeth, and said she shouldn't wonder if it
would be all the fashion to walk that side after that.</p>

<p>Lord Morpeth bowed agin, and looked as meek as new milk,
and kinder acted as if he'd jest as lives talk about something
else, but my pussy cousin stuck to him like a dog to a briar.</p>

<p>"Now my Lord," sez she, a laying her hand on to his'n,
rings and all, "now, arter reading my darter's poetry, jest give
me your opinion; we shouldn't think of ever letting her print
anything, on'y we've heard that it's getting to be the fashion for
English Lords and ladies to be sort of literary, and Jemima is
so full of poetry and writes so sweet and soft&mdash;don't you think
so, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"Very soft," says Lord Morpeth, as sober as a deacon, but yet
giving a sort of a sly squint at Jemima, where she sot a puckering
up her mouth and half shutting her eyes, and a shaking for'ard
her yaller curls, till they eenamost touched her lap, and a
trying to look like a love-sick robin on an apple-tree limb.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't form no idee, you can't, indeed," sez Miss
Slick, "without you hear Jemima read them herself, but she's so
modest, so sensitive&mdash;but mebby she'll be persuaded by your
lordship."</p>

<p>Lord Morpeth give another squint at the stuck up little varmint,
and sed, "he was afeared to urge the young lady agin her feelings."</p>

<p>"Oh, but she'll do it to oblige you, I'm sartin she will," sez
Miss Slick agin; "and here's our literary cousin, he will persuade
her, I am sure;" and with that she cum across the room and put
her hand on my coat sleeve, and sez she, "Now do, cousin."</p>

<p>"Oh, you go to grass," sez I; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234] </a></span>"If Jemima there is a mind to
make a coot of herself, she can do it without my boosting her
along." Lord Morpeth kinder give a start, and looked at me
like all natur, but yet he didn't look mad.</p>

<p>"Why, Cousin Slick!" sez my pussey she cousin, a dropping
her hand as if it had gripped a hot potatoe.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" sez Jemima.</p>

<p>Jase he let his watch-key drop, and turned as red as a tomato.
"What on arth do you mean by that, Mr. Jonathan Slick?" sez
he.</p>

<p>"Wal, I reckon I mean just what I say," sez I, a dropping my
hands into my trousers pockets; and a crossing one boot over
t'other, as I leaned sort of slantindicular, with my shoulder agin
the mantle-tree. "If there's anything on arth that makes a
man sick of all the feminine gender, it's the etarnal hankering
which some on 'em get to show off and trot themselves out afore
the men folks, jest to show that their stockings have been in a
dye-tub, and that what they are lacking in brains, is made up by
impudence. I wouldn't marry a gal that could get up afore a
stranger, before a hull room full on 'em, and shake her curls
about, roll up her eyes like a pious hen, and squinch her face over
a lot of poetry, whether it's her's or anybody else's. I swow, I
wouldn't marry her if her heart was a solid lump of gold, and
every hair of her head strung with diamonds. That's my opinion,
and Cousin Jemima is welcome to it such as it is."</p>

<p>I wish you could a seen Jase and his wimmen folks when I
burst out with that speech. Didn't they turn red and white in
streaks? I ruther guess so! And Lord Morpeth! I never seed
a feller's face brighten up as his did. Jase put his arm through
mine, and asked me to slip into the hall a minit.</p>

<p>"Look a here, cousin, this is ruther too bad," sez Jase, eenamost
crying; "you ought to make apology to his lordship for
speaking so afore him&mdash;what'll he think of American manners?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235] </a></span></p>
<p>"What'll he think," sez I, "darn me if I care what he thinks;
if he's a ginuine nobleman&mdash;one that's got good English common
sense&mdash;he wont think the better of us for trying to make believe
we're a notch above what we raly be, and he'll like my human
natur better than your soft sodder by a jug full. If he expects
the hull nation of America to pucker and twist itself out of all
nat'ral shape jest to gibe with his notions, he <em>ought</em> to be disappointed
and that's the long and the short of it; and if he believes
that we want to see our wimmen folks to be spitting out poetry
and varses afore strangers, or that the ginuine wimmen of America
want to du sich things, he'd better stay to hum and read Mrs.
Trollope's books. Now, jest hold your gab, Jase," sez I, as he
was a going to speak again, "I'm in the right on't&mdash;if we want
to give these English Lords a true idea of us, act out human
natur, and give me a warm, honest welcome, but less soft soap."</p>

<p>As I'd spoke out, jest so, the bell rung, and a hull grist of big
bugs got out of some carriages at the door and come in. There
was three or four harnsome wimmen and gals dressed off in silks
and satins, with the dresses all fringed off round the bottom and
a hugging tight up to them white necks as close as the skin to an
eel, and a showing off the wide shoulders and leetle tapering
waists about the best of any dresses I ever sot eyes on. The
men folks had on span white gloves, and looked as if they'd jest
come out of a band-box. While Jase was a blustering about from
one to t'other, I jest cut stick for the other room, detarmined
not to have any more jaw with the critter if I could help it.
Miss Slick and Jemima looked sour enough to turn new milk;
but Lord Morpeth he cum right up to me and begun to talk as if
I'd been his twin brother. He asked me about every thing on
arth, and more too; all about the way we raise onions and garden
sarce, how much hay our Weathersfield meadows give to an
acre, and all about our district schools, meeting houses, and the
old blue laws of Connecticut. When I told him that a man was
fined five dollars for bussing his wife on the sabberday arter he'd
been away to sea four years, Lord Morpeth he larfed right out as
nat'ral as could be. Then I took turn about and asked him a few
pozers about Old England, and he answered right up like a man
that understood things, for all he was a Lord. I raly took a shine
to the critter, though I'd made up my mind agin it, tooth and
nail, and while he was a talking I took a good squint at his head
and face.</p>

<p>He aint so over harnsome, not quite so good looking as a
sartin chap I could tell you on if I wasn't so mealy-mouthed, but
then he's got an allfired big head, high up over the ears, and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236] </a></span>that looks chuck full of brains as an egg is full of meat. His
eyes aint great black starers like some folk's, but as bright as
diamonds, and as sharp as a hull paper of cambrick needles, and
they know how to look right straight through a feller without
flinching the first glance.</p>

<p>Purty soon, the gals and them chaps I'd seen in the hall cum
a pouring in, and then there was no more talk with Lord Morpeth;
he had to be led around like a race-horse by Miss Slick
and Jemima, and I cum in for my share of the fun, for arter he
and I got so thick together, they begun to think what I'd said was
according to gunter, and sot it all down for eccentricity of genius
instead of ginuine common sense; howsomever, I did not care so
long as all was ship-shape agin with 'em, for I hate to get a
woman a pouting with me, for if I'm ever so right it makes me
feel kinder ugly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE DINNER SCENE.</h3>

<p>We hadn't but just got settled down when the great wide looking-glass
that I've told you of, seemed to slide back of the curtains
to the lower eend of the room, and by gauly! there was
another room further on, with a table sot in it all kivered over
with silver plates, and soup dishes, and Chiny ware, with one of
them trees of gold and glass all lighted up, and swung to the
wall, a glittering, and flashing, and pouring down the shine over
the heap of silver things, till it made a feller ketch his breath
on'y jest to peak in.</p>

<p>Lord Morpeth he gin his arm to my pussy she cousin&mdash;Jase gin
his to a harnsome gal that stood close to him, and I crooked
my elbow up to Jemima, for I kinder wanted to make up for
what I'd sed about her reading&mdash;poor critter! she aint to blame
if she is a little shaller. The rest on 'em followed on two and
two, and arter a little we all sot down round the table with six
great strapping fellers, with blue and white regimentals on, and
gloves on all their twelve hands, a standing up behind our chairs.
I can't give you no idea of what we had to eat, for they called
every thing by some darn'd jaw-breaker of a name, and kept a
carrying things on and off and giving a feller clean plates all of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237] </a></span>solid silver, till it a'most made me dizzy with seeing them a flashing
about so in the critters' hands. They had all sorts of mince
meat with hard names tucked to it, and fish kivered with gravy,
and butter, and every thing else, and sich a darn'd heap of things
that I can't begin to tell you all. I tried to take a bite of everything,
but it wasn't of no use&mdash;I was purty well filled up afore
the puddings, and pies, and custards cum on, and arter they were
carried off I thought we'd all made a purty good Thanksgiving
dinner, considering it wasn't to hum, and I can't tell when I've
felt so big and pussy; but jest as I was thinking we'd got about
through, the fellers went to work and swept the hull table clean
as could be, and by-am-by on they cum agin with silver baskets
full of grapes, and oranges, and prunes, with a grist of fust rate
apples, and hull bunches of raisins that made a feller feel wrothy
because he'd eat enough, they looked so tempting a hanging over
the sides of them silver baskets, and a looking so meller in the
light that cum a shining down from the consarn overhead.</p>

<p>When the wimmen folks had jest eat a few grapes, and mebby
a chunk of orange or so, Miss Slick she got up and off they went
into t'other room, but yet a looking back sort of longing, jest as
Eve did when the angels made her quit the garden of Eden,
poor critter!</p>

<p>The minit the wimmen folks had made themselves scarce the
servants begun to cut about like all possessed, and a hull regiment
of decanters and cider bottles with sheet-lead caps to 'em,
marched onto the table, and arter them cum another regiment of
glasses, some of 'em round and bulky with short stems and
kinder dark green, some white as ice, and then agin some that
was short and slender, cut on in squares, and red as a gal's lip,
besides the long necked cider glasses that stood poking up among
the rest, like a Down East gineral, and his officers ready to lead
on the red and green militia agin the hull squad of bottles and
decanters, till one side gin up beat. The help gin the first shot, for
each on 'em took a bottle, and pop, pop, pop, went the corks&mdash;then
the red, and green, and white glasses marched up, and cum
off chuck full and a brimming over with plunder. As for me, I
sent up a long necked feller and took a swig at the cider, and Lord
Morpeth he went dead into the green glasses, but they put me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238] </a></span>in mind of an old maid's goggles, and I couldn't take a notion to
'em till arter I'd drunk two hull glasses of the cider, and then I
didn't seem to care what I drank out on. By-am-by some one
called out and wanted a toast. I never heard of topping off a
Thanksgiving dinner with toast afore, but it made me think of
hum, and so I thought I'd have one tu.</p>

<p>"Look a here," sez I to the chap that stood back of my chair,
"you may make me a toast tu, but none of your dry stuff now,
but make it as marm used to, you remember Jase," sez I, "half
a pint of hot milk with a chunk of butter about as big as a piece
of chalk melted in, and then the hull soaked up with slices of
toasted bread&mdash;hum made is best&mdash;one slice laid on top of t'other.
Now you git out, and make some right off," sez I to the chap,
sez I.</p>

<p>"Look a here, Jonce, what are you about?" sez Jase, a poking
his elbow sort of sly into my ribs. "It aint that we mean, we're
a going to drink a toast."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I haint no arthly objection, but if the feller
makes it according to rule it'll be ruther tough to swaller without
some chawing."</p>

<p>"I tell you," sez Jase agin, "we are a going to drink a toast
to Lord Morpeth in wine."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I agin, "I haint no objection, if Lord Morpeth likes
toast and wine, it's his idee of what's good, and I can't help it; but
as for me, hand over a bowl of ginuine toast and cider with the
bread crumbled in, Weathersfield fashion, ruther hot, and sweetened
well with lasses, that's my notion. Lord a massey, how
marm does mix them critters up, it's enough to make a feller's
nose tingle to think on it, aint it, cousin Jase."</p>

<p>It warn't of no use a speaking to him, there he stood a strutting
over back with a glass in his hand and a singing out, "Our
noble guest, Lord Morpeth," like all possessed. Every critter at
the table, excepting Lord Morpeth and I, jumped up with glasses
in our hands, and begun to drink like a patch of seed onions after
a six weeks' dry spell; but Lord Morpeth and I sot still and
looked as if we didn't know what possessed the critters; but the
minit they sot down up he jumped like a house a fire, and the
way he cracked jokes and said smart things, made the fire fly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239] </a></span>from every body's eyes round the table. I swanny, if he didn't
take me a'most off the handle with his consarned sweet voice and
harnsome manners. It raly was eenamost as good as a play, to
hear him reel out the common sense and soft sodder about this
land of liberty and old England. When he sot down, it was as
much as I could du to keep from going right up and giving him
a hug, if he was a lord. Arter this we mixed in the talk altogether,
like lemon, and sugar, and brandy in a punch bowl, as
sociable as so many chickens in a coop, till by-am-by, Jase he
begun to swell up and talk to Lord Morpeth about the Slicks, and
the crouchants, and lions, that belonged to the family coat of
arms as he called it; he gin us all to understand that the Slick's
warn't a family to be sneezed at by any of the English Lords, and
gin out some purty broad hints about a barron-night, and a lord,
that gin a start to the name ever so long back in England; then
the consarned shote branched out into a sarmon about ancient
birth, and pure blood, a running from one generation to another,
without being siled by anything low since the Slick's cum to this
country, jest arter the Pilgrims, and a hull lot of the darndest
stuff that ever a transmogrified hand-cartman thought on. I'd
topped off my cider with two or three glasses of hock, the feller
called it, and it made me feel dreadful smart, and I felt jest like
tackling Jase in his own camp.</p>

<p>"Look a here, cousin Jase," sez I, "what on arth do you want
to make out that we Slick's are anything but jest what we be,
for aint it a darned sight more to our credit, Yankees as we are,
and Republicans as we ought to be, to own it at once, that we
had to hoe our own row up, and found it a purty tough one?
Now you know well enough, for all your crouchongs, and lions,
and roosters,&mdash;that you've picked up, lord-a-massey knows where&mdash;that
you begun life, or any how begun to save up chink, fust
by a horse cart on Peck Slip, and that wife of your'n went out a
nussing other folk's children till arter you married her, and that
aint no disgrace to her nor you neither, so long as you don't try
to make out that you're something more than you raly be. It is
too bad you're trying to make out that you're a English big bug,
when you can prove yourself as good a nobleman as ever lived,
by going back to our grand-par, the brave old shoemaker, that
swung his lap-stone over his shoulder when the Revolution broke
out, and jined the patriots when their struggle was dark as the
grave. The old man never gave way once, but fought like a lion
when fighting was to be done. He clung to his companions in
good and bad luck, and though he fought, and marched, and suffered
with the toughest of 'em, never once gin out or got discouraged,
but arter a long day's march would unsling his lap-stone,
take out his rusty tools, and hammer and stitch away half the
night long, to make up shoes for his tired and sore footed feller
soldiers, whenever he could find a scrap of sole leather or a piece
of cow skin to make up!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240] </a></span></p>

<p>I was a going on, but Lord Morpeth he got up, and sez he,
"Let us drink to the memory of Mr. Slick's ancestor, the 'brave
Shoemaker.'"</p>

<p>Jase looked sort of ugly about what I'd said&mdash;but I couldn't
help that, and when Lord Morpeth jined in, the hull biling on us
got up, and another squad of wine glasses was put into action.
When the rest had sot down, I felt as if I couldn't break off so,
but I thought it wouldn't do no harm to give 'em a short specimen
of Weathersfied chin music, seeing as there was a lord to
hear me.</p>

<p>"Now," sez I, "it's of no use denying that we Yankees do
think a good deal of noble birth and pure blood, and all of them
ere things that the English have boosted up their throne with so
many hundred years; for my part, I du feel a kind of love and
reverence for a family of any kind, whose blood has run pure
from one generation to another, through brave men and good
women, till it beats full of warm ginerous human natur in the
heart of a true nobleman, whether he has a title or not. It gives
a man something to be proud of, something to guard and keep
himself good and honorable for. A man must be mean as pusley,
and meaner yet, who could do a small action while he knew
that his blood had been kept, pure as spring water, by a hull line
of good men, all a sleeping in their graves."</p>

<p>"But, arter all," sez I, "what is the nobility of Old England
more than that which we Yankees have a right to?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241] </a></span></p>

<p>"Was William the Conqueror, that they brag so much about,
any thing to be compared to our Washington? Was his conquest
of Old England, half so great, or so tough a job as the
tussle we had to get New England into our own native land? Now,
the whole truth is, blood is like wine, the older it is, the
stronger and clearer it grows. If it warn't for that, we Yankees,
that had forefathers in the Revolutionary war, have as good a
right to brag about our pure blood, as the greatest and oldest
line of proud England." Here I stopped jest long enough to
make a bow to Lord Morpeth, and on I went agin. "I say,"
sez I, a stretching out my arm, "there aint a true born
American on arth, if he owns the truth, that haint English grit
and pride enough about him to feel a kind of respect for an
English nobleman, if he behaves himself like folks: but if he
don't," sez I, "we've got a right to dispise him more than we do
one another when we act mean; for he not only disgraces
hisself, but all the forefathers that he ought to be proud on, and
a man that can do that must be mean as git out and meaner tu,
a darned sight. Now," sez I, a looking at Lord Morpeth, "we
Yankees and the English are purty much alike, for all. If
they've got their lords, and dukes, and princes, haint we no
military captins, and generals, and deacons, and squires,&mdash;rather
small potatoes compared to the English, but yet it shows a sort
of native notion we've got arter sich things, and don't du no sort
of harm one way nor t'other. Now," sez I, "in a few hundred
years from this, we Americans, shall have a sort of republican
nobility of our own. I aint sartin about the titles, but by-am-by,
when the 'tea party,' and the battle of Bunker Hill lies clear
back in our history, as William the Conquerer's does among the
British, Cousin Jase there, wouldn't have to make up a story
about his British ancestors; for the pure blood of this ere
country will be that which goes right back to the Revolutionary
war. All Yankee noblemen will have to sarch for their titles on
the pension list of this ere very generation; and the old man
that now draws his twenty dollars a month, will be the founder
of a line, jest as noble as any that ever sprung up in the heart of
old England! That's my ginuine opinion. Now," sez I, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242] </a></span>"if
we Slicks wanted to make out that we are any great shakes, it
aint no very hard job to du it. It aint by no means sartin that
we, any on us, ever had any forefathers afore the old Shoemaker,
that we've jest been a telling on; but he was a hull team and
horse to boot. When the ammunition gin out at Bunker Hill, he
flung away his gun, and went to storming a hull regiment, tooth
and nail, on his own hook, till in the eend he was shot down
dead with a piece of the old lap stun in his hand, that he
gripped like an Injun arter his teeth was sot, and his fingers
stiff and stun cold. Old England, I must own, has got a grist
of noble families and great men, that are an honor and etarnal
glory to it, but the blood that biled up in that old man's heart,
was as red, as brave, yes, and as noble tu, as ever poured itself
out on the sile of old England, in the time of William, or any
other Conqueror; and if I ever set up for a big bug, and put
picters on my carriage door, I kinder think that I shan't be
much ashamed to have Jonathan Slick's coat of arms, a 'hand
gripped hard on a lap-stun;' for consarn me, if we, any on us,
ever get to be much, it will be through the old Shoemaker, and
I aint ashamed to own it."</p>

<p>With that I took another swig at the hock, and was a going
on agin, but all tu once my head began to whirl round like a
top. The table began to spread itself into half a dozen, and it
seemed as if the glass consarn over head had got a hull family
of leetle ones around it, dancing jigs and pouring out the shine
all over the room&mdash;and then the wine bottles, and the decanters,
and the grapes, and apples, and raisins, seemed to get onsteady,
and more on 'em kept a starting up. Then the waiters in regimentals
grew taller and taller, and I'm consarned if Lord
Morpeth hadn't half a dozen chaps a looking like so many twin
brothers a dodging up and down all around him, awful onsteady
though, for Lords. Then, arter all, the floor begun to rise and
pitch up and down till I was obliged to give up, and so I sot
down, and held onto my chair with both hands, and called out
'Whoa' like a house afire, for it seemed as if everything was a
getting upsot; and between you and I and the post, Par, my
ginuine opinion is, that all the chaps in the room had got about
half seas over, except me. I was as steddy as a judge, and sot
up parpendicular and independent, jest as a true born Republican
ought tu, determined to set that English Lord and the rest on
'em a good example. It wasn't no wonder, though, that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243] </a></span>got a leetle how come-you-so, for they all drank wine, but I
only took that sparkling white cider and hock, for I was detarmined
not to make a shote of myself. Yet it made me feel so
bad to see how they went on, that I got a'most sick thinking
about it.</p>

<p>Arter a while we all went back into the keeping-room, and
there the wimmen folks sot on them red benches, all in pimlico
order, drinking coffee out of some leetle finefied cups, but I'm
afeared they didn't set up so straight as young ladies ought tu
in company&mdash;their heads did seem to set rather unsartin on
their shoulders every time I looked at 'em.</p>

<p>I drunk off a cup of coffee jest to oblige Jase, and then I
begun to be kinder sociable with a young gal that sot by Jemima,
while Jase took Lord Morpeth round to look at his marble
head, and the two whopping picters of himself and wife.</p>

<p>Arter he had gone the rounds&mdash;as we Editors say of a prime
article&mdash;Lord Morpeth made his bow and went out, I begun to
feel kinder as if I'd like to take a snooze, and so I jest gin one
smashing bow at the door for all, and arter getting my hat, I
follered Lord Morpeth out. It was tarnal cold, and I begun to
chirk up a leetle, when I see that Jase's carriage stood there.
Lord Morpeth stepped back when he see me close to him, and
moved his hand as much as to say&mdash;Git in; but I stepped back,
and sez I, "I guess I've been taught better manners than to
help myself fust,"&mdash;so with that he got in, and I arter.</p>

<p>We had a good deal of talk in the carriage; and when we
both got out, Lord Morpeth shook hands with me as if I'd been
his twin brother, and asked me to come and see him to his room,
for he wanted to talk with me about picters and the fine arts,
and things in general.</p>

<p>I gin his hand an allfired grip, and sez I, "Lord Morpeth, you
can depend on this chap, for he'll tell you the truth and no soft
sodder. I didn't take much of a notion to you at fust, for I aint
a chap to run arter you because you're a lord, but I like you in
<em>spite</em> of that, for you're a darned good hearted, smart critter,
and lord or no lord, that's enough."</p>

<p>With that I shook hands agin, and went up stairs to bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244] </a></span>Fanny Elssler didn't keep me awake that night I reckon. That

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan rides to Mill&mdash;The Millerite Excitement&mdash;His Marm waits
for the World to come to an End&mdash;Letter from New York&mdash;The
old White Horse.</p>

<p><i>To the Editors of the New York Express, a darned great Newspaper
down in York.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gentlemen Sirs:</span></p>

<p>I s'pose your letter came down from York like a streak of
chalk, but I've got kinder out of the literary world since I cum
back hum here, and I didn't hear a word about it till the 22d of
April, jest as all Weathersfield had got their robes made and
their caps sot for t'other world.</p>

<p>I'd been out to work all day in the onion patch, and toward
night I thought it wouldn't do no harm to take a ride and git
the kinks out of my back. So I jest went to the barn, and arter
saddling the old horse, and measuring out some rye from the bin
I went into the house for some bags, and concluded I'd go to
mill, and take the way back by old White's, jest to see how
Judy got along arter the last singing school.</p>

<p>Wal, I took a short cut through the orchard, and it made me
feel kinder chirk to hear the robins a singing in the apple trees,
and to see the young buds busting out all over my head, and the
grass a sprouting under my feet, all on it a looking fresh as a
gal's lip, and greener than a hull meetin-house full of Millerites.
The peach trees in the back yard had jest begun to blow out;
they warn't in full blow yet, but seemed to be kinder blushing
all over at their own back'ardness; and that are old pear tree by
the well, looked as if natur had shook a flour bag all over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245] </a></span>it, and yit, the old critter wasn't in full blow more than the rest
on 'em. I wasn't dry, but the air smelt so tarnal sweet, and the
water in the bucket, that was a leetle leaky, kept a falling drop,
drop, drop, down the well, so kinder tempting, that I couldn't
help ketching hold of the well-pole as I went by, and after
tilting the bucket on the curb, I tipt it down and took a drink
that raly did me good.</p>

<p>Wal, I went through the yard, and opened the back kitchen
door to ask marm for the bags, and there she sot, close by the
table, with her linsey woolsey apron on yit, jest as she'd washed
the morning dishes. Her old gray hair was sort a rumpled up
under her cap, and her steel spectacles had slid half way down
her nose, she was bending so arnest over the big Bible, and
reading the Prophecies of Daniel. Poor old marm, she looked
dreadfully wamblecropped, as if she'd jest made the discovery
of a new mare's egg in the Bible, and was waiting to see what
sort of a critter it would hatch out.</p>

<p>"Marm," sez I, "if you'll give me the bags I'll go to the mill,
the last grist must be purty nearly out by this time."</p>

<p>Marm sot still, looking at the Bible, and didn't seem to know
as I was talking. She shook her head kinder awful, till the
specs rattled on her nose, and then she groaned out something
consarning fire and brimstone and the eend of all things; and
she wiped her eyes with her apron, as if she felt dreadfully and
couldn't help it.</p>

<p>"Marm," sez I, "what on arth ails you? you'll make me boo-hoo
right out, if you look so melancholy and take on so."</p>

<p>Marm give a jump, and looked up sort a skeery, and sez she,
"Oh, dreadful suz! Jonathan, is it only you?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I reckon so," sez I; "where's the bags?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jonathan!" sez she, "are you ready for the eend?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sez I, "I guess I be; I ruther calculate these two
strings are tough enough to tie up the eend of any bag on these
ere premises."</p>

<p>Marm shook her head agin, and her face was as solemncholy
as a gal that's got the mitten, and sez she, "Jonathan," sez she,
"have you ever calculated on the beast with the horns?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246] </a></span></p>
<p>"Wal," sez I, a putting my hands in my pockets, "I can't say
that I ever calculated much on them critters; if you and par
want me to take 'em, I don't object to the old oxen, but I'd a
leetle ruther have the black steers, if you'd jest as lives."</p>

<p>Marm shook her head worse than ever.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "the old oxen will do, so chirk up and tell me
where the bags are."</p>

<p>With that I went up the back stairs and found the things
myself, and was a going out when she called arter me, and, sez
she, "Jonathan, Jonathan, don't go on so&mdash;oh dear me, poor unregenerate
critter, what do we want of another grist; have you
forgot Miller and his promise?"</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious, no," sez I, a swinging my bags over the
old horse, "how could I forget him&mdash;he's as clever a critter as
ever lived, and he promised to give this grist a tarnation bolting:
I told him how mad you was about t'other."</p>

<p>With that I got out the horse, hitched up the bags to make 'em
lie even under me, give the bridle a shake and jogged on,
wondering what on arth had sot marm up so. Jest as I was a
turning down the lane toward Squire White's, I looked back and
there she was a standing by the winder, with both hands up, and
her cap knocked a one side like a crazy critter. Jest then par
come across the corn lot, where he and old uncle White had been
a ploughing, and I told him what a tantrum marm was in about
the oxen and the grist.</p>

<p>Par shook his head, and sez he, "Consarn that Miller! she's
been a brooding over the varmint's nonsense this ever so long,
till she couldn't sleep a nights, and now as it's jest coming on to
the 23d of April, I s'pose she's broke out in a new spot."</p>

<p>"Darn the old scamp to darnation!" sez I, "it's jest got
through my head what ails marm; the sneaking old varmint, he
ought to be sung to death by screech owls, and knocked into the
middle of next week by crippled grasshoppers!" With that I
rode along, and par went hum, a looking jest as if he was ready
to bust out a crying or a swearing, he didn't care which.</p>

<p>Wal, I was purty much womblecropped all the way to the
mill, for somehow it made me feel sort of all-overish to think how
near the time had come. I wasn't raly a skeered, but every
thing looked pokerish all around. The mill was shet up, so I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247] </a></span>stood up my grist at the door, and got on to the old horse agin,
detarmined to ride into town and see if I could find any thing to
chirk me up. Jest as I got agin the post office, a chap hollered
out that they'd got a letter for me from York, post paid and all.
I turned up and laid the bridle on the old horse's neck, while I
broke open the letter and read it. By gauley! didn't it make my
heart jump right up into my mouth! But yet I felt a leetle
uneasy about it. I wanted to come like all natur, but par hain't
been willing to hear a word about York never since I took sich a
shine to Miss Elssler, at the Astor House, and I was afeard that
he'd say no to it. Then there was marm and Judy White both
on 'em sot agin York, and hating Miss Elssler like rank pison;
howsomever, I'm purty good grit when I sot out in arnest, and
I rode along thinking the matter over till I got to old Mr.
White's. Judy come out with her calico sun bonnet on, looking
good enough to eat.</p>

<p>"Come, Judy," sez I, "jump on behind, and go hum with me;
marm has got a fit of the dreadful suz, about that tarnal old Miller's
bisness, and I want you to chirk her up a leetle, if you
can."</p>

<p>Judy run up to the fence, so I made the old horse side up
while she took off her check apron and spread it on behind.
"Come up," sez I agin to the old critter; he got so close to the
fence that he a'most smashed my leg agin the boards, and then
shied agin; but Judy White is clear grit and no mistake&mdash;she
give a jump and cum down square right on the crooper with one
arm round me. The horse shied agin; Judy kinder slipped a
leetle, and she hung on to me closer yit, and larfed till you
couldn't tell which made the sweetest noise, she or the robins in
old White's orchard. When I turned to ketch her, them pesky
red lips of her'n were poked right agin my face; the harnsome
varmint hung on to me with both arms like all natur, and every
time she larfed out, that tempting breath of her'n come right
over my mouth. Consarn the critter, I eenamost gin her a buss
afore I knew it, and when the tee-hee bust out through them
lips agin, I had to stop her mouth for fear she'd scare the
horse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248] </a></span></p>
<p>"Now you git out, Jonathan!" sez she, a righting herself agin
in no time; "aint you ashamed?"</p>

<p>That stubborn old varmint begun another double shuffle, right
there in the street, and it was all I could du to hold him in, so I
hadn't no time to mollify Judy with another buss. The critter
wouldn't speak a word all the way hum, but there she sot, with
one arm round me kinder loose, as if she'd a kept herself on some
other way if she could, and a holding on her sun bonnet with
t'other hand, till one couldn't git the leastest peep at her face.
It was purty near dark when we got hum. The cows stood by
the gate a lowing to be milked. The old hens, setting ones and
all, come round us hilter-skilter, as if they were eenamost starved
to death, and when we got into the kitchen, there stood the table
jest as it was left arter breakfast, covered with dirty dishes; the
strainer lay in a leetle wad in one of the sarsers, and the cat was
a licking off the cream from a pan of milk that stood on a chair
by the cheese-room door. Marm had gone off and shut herself
up in the out room, with the Bible and a hull heap of the "Midnight
Cry" newspapers.</p>

<p>I swanny, it eenamost made me boo-hoo right out to see how
the things lay about the house. There never was a neater critter
on arth than marm; but the hull premises raly looked more like
a hog pen than any thing else. Judy and I went to work like
good fellers&mdash;she forgot to be mad and tackled to, washing dishes
and gitting supper, while I went out to milk. Marm wouldn't
come to supper, and par eenamost choked with every mouthful
he eat, and yit he looked more than half wrathy, as if he'd about
as much trouble to keep his dander down as to hold up the tears
that every once in a while kept a dropping from under his eyes
down the side of his nose.</p>

<p>I guess you never sot eyes on so melancholy a set of critters
as sot round our kitchen till midnight, for marm wouldn't go to
bed, and we were afeard to leave her up alone in the out room
with that pictur of the horned beast a staring her right in the
eyes. When the old clock struck twelve, we heard the out door
room shut to, and by-am-by marm come where we sot in the
kitchen, dressed out in a great long consarn like an overgrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249] </a></span>night-gown, with white shoes on her old feet, and that gray hair
of her'n a hanging down her back; I swow, it made me ketch
my breath to see her!</p>

<p>I haint got the heart to write all the shines marm cut up that
night and all day the Sunday arter&mdash;it seems like pokin fun
at one's own marm&mdash;as she went from one room to t'other, a
ringing her hands and a crying her eyes out, because we wouldn't
put on the robes she'd made for us, and go right up to heaven
without making a fuss about it. I thought it wouldn't do no
harm to try and rile her up to thinking of something besides the
horned beast.</p>

<p>"Marm," sez I, all tu once, "I can't think of fixing up for
t'other world yit, no how. I've jest got a letter from York, and
if you're so detarmined on going to heaven, I ruther guess York's
the place for me."</p>

<p>Marm jumped right up from her knees, and sez she, "Jonathan
what <em>du</em> you mean?"</p>

<p>My heart riz; it was the only sign of gumption she had made
for a hull day. Par looked up, and his chin kinder quivered, for
he thought I was poking fun at the old woman, and Judy White,
she sidled up to me, and sez she, all in a twitter, "Jonathan you
aint in arnest now?"</p>

<p>"If I was, would you give up and let me go?" sez I.</p>

<p>Darn the harnsome critter, how mad she looked! "No I
won't nor touch tu!" sez she, and afore I knew it, she bust right
out a crying and went out of the room.</p>

<p>I didn't foller her, for marm had got down on her knees agin,
and was a looking through her specs at a tarnal big thunder cloud
that cum a rolling its blackness in knolls and furrows all over the
sky, as if the world had raly cum to an eend, and all the niggers
in creation was a going up fust.</p>

<p>Marm's face was as white as a taller candle, she was enough
to scare anybody out of a week's growth, a kneeling there in that
white gown, and her old hands a wrenching away at each other,
like a crazy critter. Thinks I, I'll try and rile her up agin, but
it wasn't of the leastest use, she wouldn't git up from the winder,
but knelt there stock still&mdash;with her head flung back'ards, and
the lightning a blazing over her steel specs, and the grizzley hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250] </a></span>that hung away down her back. I swan to man, it made my
hair stand on eend to look at her. By-am-by the thunder come
a rolling and tumbling through the clouds, as if somebody was a
blasting rocks up above: and the lightning come a streaming out
agin in great blazes of fire, till it seemed as if all natur was
turned wrong eend up, and all the brick kilns, coal mines, and
founderies on arth were a playing away in the clouds, and a
groaning and hissing through the rain that came down in pailsfull,
and a scaring folks to death.</p>

<p>"There!&mdash;look a there!" sez marm all tu once, a jumping up,
and a stretching her arm through the winder. "I'm ready&mdash;I'm
a coming!&mdash;Look a there, Deacon Zephaniah Slick&mdash;look there,
my unregenerated son&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>Sure as a gun, there was something all dressed out in white a
standing in the orchard, right agin the winder. Par and Judy
White&mdash;for the critter ran back from the out room when she see
that I wasn't a going to foller her&mdash;riz right up, and they wur
about the streakedest looking critters that ever you sot eyes on.
Jest then cum a loud noise&mdash;snort, snort, snort&mdash;from the orchard.
"Oh gracious me!" sez marm&mdash;"the trumpet! the trumpet!"&mdash;and
down she slumped on her knees agin.</p>

<p>"By gracious," think sez I, "I'll see what the matter is, any
how;" so I gin a dive to the winder, and I hollored out, "shew&mdash;stuboy&mdash;git
out!" but I kinder think I didn't yell over loud,
the words stuck like wax-eends in my throat, and afore I could
git 'em untangled, out cum the noise agin, louder, and twice as
scary as it was before.</p>

<p>Think sez I, "Gracious knows, I'm afeard we're gone suckers,
but I'll try agin anyhow;" so sez I, a clapping my hands, "git
away, you varmint, tramp&mdash;scoot&mdash;stuboy&mdash;y&mdash;y&mdash;"</p>

<p>I guess I yelled it out like a training gun that time. The
white spirit seemed to feel it tu, for it flung its arms in the dark,
and gin us another blast of his consarned old trumpet. Jest then
the lightning came cutting down agin, and&mdash;oh, git out!&mdash;it was
only the old white horse, a snorting and a kicking up his heels,
in the orchard. I sot down, and haw-hawed right out, till it
was all I could du to catch my breath agin; then I bust out
agin, till par and Judy jined chorus, and we made the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251] </a></span>house ring as if there had been a quilting frolic in it: just then
the clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>"Hurra!" I sung out, "marm, the 23d of April has cum and
gone; come, marm, git up, the storm is blowing over, and the
moon haint turned to blood yit. Hurra!"</p>

<p>I was jest a going to give poor old marm a buss, but par had
got her in his arms a kissing her white face, and a boo-hooing,
the old coot, like a spring colt. So as the buss was all made up,
and too heavy for my mouth, I gin it to Judy. And she handed
over a cuff for pay, the tanterlizing little snapping turtle.</p>

<p>Judy was all sot to rights agin, afore the old horse had got
over his double shuffle.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, only to think that I should a cut up such a heap
of factory cloth, and all for nothing!" sez marm arter a while.</p>

<p>We didn't say much to marm that night, but when par and
she got up to go to bed, she took a slantindicular look at her robe,
and then gin a sneaking squint at us. I couldn't hardly keep
from busting right out agin, but choked in. And par says,&mdash;he
never seems to mind it&mdash;"you can use it for a night-gown."
When the old folks had gone, Judy and I went into the out room,
and seeing as it was Sunday night, and nobody to interfere, we
sot down, and hitching our chairs close together, didn't get sleepy
till nigh about morning, but kept on talking, as chipper as two
birds. I didn't say anything to Judy about coming to York; she
is a sneezer when her dander is once up, and I kinder think it
best to come off, and then write a letter to her arter it is all done.
She's allfired jealous of the York gals, and dreads them that
dance like Miss Elssler as a cat hates hot soap.</p>

<p>I guess I shall cum any how, but not jest yit. I must git in
all the onions fust, and help about the grain some; arter that,
you'll see me at the office as large as life, and twice as nat'ral.
Par wont hear a word on it yit, I'm sartin, he got so allfired
uneasy about me and Miss Elssler, that he sent for me right hum,
when I was at the Express office; he thinks politics and dancing
gals about the meanest things that a feller can hanker arter. But
I'll set Captin Doolittle to arguing the matter with him, and as
for marm, I guess she'll feel rather tu streaked to make much of
a fuss about any thing jest now. I meant to cum the soft sodder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252] </a></span>over her a leetle any how; so this morning I went out to my
onion bed back of the barn, where the sun comes all day from
morning till night, and I pulled up a harnful of young onions
that would make your mouth water; they had the tenderest
green tops you ever see, and when I held 'em up and shook the
dirt off, they looked more like a harnful of snow drops a blowing
out at the wrong eend, than anything else. I gin these to marm,
jest as she was a setting down to breakfast. She was eenamost
tickled to death with them, and I reckon that is one long step
towards York.</p>

<p>Mebby I shall be in York afore you git another letter from
these parts and mebby not, there's no knowing when I can git
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Here I am, safe and sound, but about the tiredest critter that
you ever sot eyes on. Afore I got to Bridgeport, I begun to be
kinder sorry that I didn't stand my chance and come on with
Captin Doolittle in the sloop, for the fust thing that I see arter I
got tu cousin Smith's in Bridgeport, was the old sloop a scooting
down the Sound like a four horse team, with all sails sot, and
loaded down to the water with garden sarce. It seemed tu me

the deck and a poking fun at me for coming down on the old
mare. The poor colt tu was eenamost tuckered out, and I begun
tu feel sort o' wamblecropped for fear something would happen
tu one of the poor critters afore I got tu York; but my keeping
didn't cost nothing, and I got cousin Smith to put a good feed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253] </a></span>one eend of my saddle-bags and gin the colt a warm drink of
milk afore we started in the morning, so we all three on us
jogged on towards Stamford, in party good condition, considerin'.
Our cousin at Stamford warn't tu hum, so I had to put the old
mare and colt up to a tavern, and arter letting into a few of
marm's doughnuts, that lightened one eend of my saddle-bags
quite a considerable, I turned in till morning. The barkeeper
made me pay three York shillings for the horse keeping. My
grit riz at it, for the old mare looked as lank as a shad; but I
didn't want to git into a scrape, so I shelled out, and rode along
darning all the cousins to darnation. What are the varmints
good for, if they can't be tu hum when a feller travels their way?</p>

<p>It was purty well into the morning when I got down to York;
the old mare was eenamost tired out, and I begun to think she
wouldn't cut much of a dash; but jest as we were turning down
the Bowery, she got a sight of one of them consarned great railroad
cars, and seemed to take it for a stable trying to run off; for
she gin a snort, stuck her tail right straight out and her ears right
up, and away she streaked it arter the cars, like a house a fire
and no engines to be had. The colt, it come a whinnering arter,
and if we didn't cut a figger, you never saw one in the multiplication
table. My coat tail was a streaming out behind, and I held
on to my bell-crowned hat with one hand while I shook my bridle
with t'other, and stuboyed the old critter along; for I didn't
want the people to think that I was afeard to go as fast as any
thing in creation took a notion to, if it was a steam engine loaded
with fire and brimstun, instead of a harnsome bay mare with a
nussing colt.</p>

<p>Jest as we got away down the Bowery, the cars stopped stock
still, and the mare cum up and saw that it was only a box full of
folks, she kicked up her heels till I was eenamost spilt in the
street. The colt it come up and flurished its leetle spindle
shanks agin the car, jest as its mother had afore, and away we
went, cutting dirt down Chatham street like a streak of iled
lightning, till I drew the mare up with a snort and a kick that
tapered off into a double shuffle right agin the Express office.</p>

<p>I jumped off and streaked it into the office, and right up stairs,
three steps at a time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254] </a></span></p>
<p>I walked right into the editor's room, with my hand out, and sez I,</p>

<p>"How do you du?"</p>

<p>Afore he could answer, a clock in the City Hall steeple struck.
The editor, he jumped up, and sez he,</p>

<p>"We're tu late, the boat is off. There's your ticket, Mr. Slick,
but it's of no use now."</p>

<p>I took the paper that he gin me,&mdash;it was an invite to meet the
President, and the boat was off.</p>

<p>"Darn me, if I don't ketch up with him!" sez I, and out I
went, right ahead down stairs, with out another word.</p>

<p>"Look a here," sez I to the boy that held the mare, "when
the President comes in, you jest lead my horse down to the landing,
and I'll give you a four-pence-ha'penny, clear silver."</p>

<p>"I'll du it," sez the little chap.</p>

<p>"You'll be a man before your marm," sez I, a turning the
corner, to go the shortest cut to Peck Slip.</p>

<p>Captin Doolittle, was jest a hauling in, but I gin the old bell
crown a swing, and sez I, "Hold on, you consarned old coot, hold
on, and hist sail arter the President."</p>

<p>With that I jumped aboard a boat, and afore I reached the
sloop she had worked about and was ready for a chase. The
wind was coming right up the East River&mdash;and the minit I
jumped aboard, Captin Doolittle, he and the black boy gin a
hurra, and the way we cut water was a caution to small craft.
We ploughed right ahead, full chisel, down the harbor, till by-am-by
we saw two steamboats a coming towards us, brim full,
and a running over with people&mdash;with banners a flying, and
colors a streaming&mdash;toot horns a blowing, and fifes a letting off
Yankee Doodle&mdash;drums a rattling out "Hail Columbia," and the
big paddles a playing the water up, till it seemed tu kinder
ketch fire in the hot sun, and drop into the waves to get cool agin.</p>

<p>"Captin," sez I, "hist another flag."</p>

<p>The captin, he put his chaw of terbacco into t'other cheek, and
sez he, "I haint got none."</p>

<p>"I guess I have," sez the leetle nigger, a running down into
the cabin.</p>

<p>In a minit he cum back with one of the captin's red woollen
shirts fastened to the eend of a bean pole, and he stuck it up on
the stern of the sloop, jest as we cum bearing right down on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255] </a></span>two steamboats.</p>

<p>A tall chap with a sort of good natered face, but the darndest
fish-hawk nose that you ever sot eyes on, stood with a lot of
fellers on the deck of the boat that had the most music in it&mdash;an
old codger, with a blue coat lined and faced all over with yaller,
and a cocked hat right on his head, with one eend curling up,
jest over his nose, like a hen-hawk ready to pick his eyes out,
and with his two legs swallered up in a pair of black and yaller
boots, stood close by the man with the nose.</p>

<p>"Captin Doolittle," sez I, "get out the gun, there's the President."</p>

<p>"What, that old chap with the yaller legs and breast," sez he,
"that looks like an overgrown grasshopper a skipping out of the
last century into this?"</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I, "that's the President of the United States, I
haint no doubt&mdash;so three cheers, and then blaze away!"</p>

<p>The nigger, he went down and brought up the old gun&mdash;Captin
Doolittle, he loaded her down purty tight, pushed the charge
hum with his ramrod, shook down the powder in the pan, and
arter trying it to his shoulder, sez he,</p>

<p>"Jonathan, go ahead."</p>

<p>"I took a squint at the leetle nigger tu see if all was ready, and
then I off with my old bell-crown," and sez I, "now"&mdash;with that
I gin it a flurrish&mdash;"Hurra!!!" I yelled out like the bust of a
cannon&mdash;"Hurra!!" sung out Captin Doolittle on the taper eend
of my yell&mdash;"Hurra!" squeaked the leetle nigger. With that
the old gun banged away, and the tall man with the nose, he
bowed and flurrished his hand at us, and with that I saw Alderman
Purdy, a chap that used to come to the Express office when
I was there afore, and the minit he saw that it was me, the boat
stopped all tu once, and begun tu snort and roll on the water like
a sick porpoise, and some one sung out, "Cum aboard."</p>

<p>Captin Doolittle and the nigger, they let down the boat, and
afore I knew it there I was, standing in the steamboat. The
minit I stepped aboard, the swad of fellers on deck with toot-horns
and fifes and drums, let out a hull thunder storm of music.
Captin Doolittle, he banged off the old gun agin; the leetle nigger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256] </a></span>he got up an extra shirt and gin another leetle hurra; and
Mr. Purdy, sez he,</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, the President wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I haint no objection, only give me time to slick
up a mite."</p>

<p>With that I took out my hankercher and kinder dusted off my
new coat and trousers, and slicked down my hair a leetle, and I
follered Mr. Purdy, right up tu where the President was a standing,
in his yaller clothes and his cocked hat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tyler, how do you du?" sez I, a taking one hand from
my trousers' pocket, and a holding it out.</p>

<p>The yaller chap, he stepped back a leetle, and the tall coon,
with the nose, he gin my hand a tarnal grip, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, I'm glad tu see you."</p>

<p>"You're kinder got the advantage of me, I reckon," sez I, but
that minit Alderman Purdy whispered to me,</p>

<p>"Why, it's the President," sez he.</p>

<p>"Gauly oppilus," sez I, "you don't say so!"</p>

<p>"Mr. President, how do you du, and how are all the folks tu
hum, about these times, all purty smart I s'pose?" With that I
worked away at the old chap's hand, with both mine, as if I'd
made up my mind tu pump an office out of him, afore I let
go.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "Captin, I hope you mean to stay in York a
spell, now you've got here; some harnsome gals about these
diggings jest now, rale sneezers in the way of beauty&mdash;you haint
no idee of that sort, nor nothing have you?" sez I, a giving him
a slantindicular squint from one eye, and a leetle punch in the
ribs with the tip eend of my finger, "no you haint now."</p>

<p>The captin he larfed, and sez he, "Oh no, I'm only making a
little unpremeditated tour a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I, "an <em>accidental</em> visit."</p>

<p>The captin gin me a squint across his nose, and then I made
him a low bow, and sez I, "Jest so, but the folks seem tu be
rather tickled with sich accidents, don't they?"</p>

<p>This seemed to kinder mollify the captin, and jest as I was a
spreading myself for a new speech, a feller cum up with a great
red and green and white rosy, pinned on to his coat, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257] </a></span>whispered tu the President, and the President looked round tu
me, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, they tell me that the collation is ready&mdash;will you
go with me into the ladies' cabin, and lead down one of my fair
friends?"</p>

<p>I made him a prime bow&mdash;a rale darnsing school smasher&mdash;and,
sez I,</p>

<p>"Wal now, I don't know what kind of horned cattle a collation
is, but seeing as it's you, I'll tackle in, if it's only tu git acquainted
with a downright ginuine fair friend of your'n, captin, for
folks say that your friends are purty darned <em>unfair</em> in a gineral
way."</p>

<p>"Folks don't du me justice," sez he, a turning red in the gills;
"No man ever had better or devoted friends on arth."</p>

<p>"What there is on 'em," sez I.</p>

<p>The captin didn't seem tu hear me, but he took out his chaw of
terbacco and pitched it over the side of the boat. I dug both
hands into my trousers' pockets, and sez I tu the man with the
silk rosy, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, now, I s'pose it's about time for you and I and the
President to be a movin. Where du you keep that critter of
your'n?"</p>

<p>"What critter?" sez he.</p>

<p>"Why, the collation?" sez I.</p>

<p>"Down in the cabin," sez he.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "I hope the varmint is considerable tame; but
come on, whose afeard!"</p>

<p>With that, Captin Tyler and I and the old yaller chap, with a
hull swad of fellers, some on 'em in training clothes, and some
on 'em with cocked hats on, went into a leetle room fenced off
from the deck, and there, jest as sartin as you live, were five or
six wimmen folks, right in amongst all them men, like one clover
top tu a hull hive of honey bees, a lookin as contented as git out.
"Wal," think sez I, "If they ain't scared, I ain't." The President
seemed to know 'em, for he put his arm right under mine
so arnest, that he eenamost lifted my right hand out of my pocket;
and, sez he,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ladies, Mr. Slick, of the New York Press."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258] </a></span></p>
<p>With that, I took off old bell-crown with one hand, and I put
out my right foot and gin a draw kinder softly into the holler of
t'other, and I bent down like a jack-knife; my eyes had tu kinder
roll up a leetle, to look into the gals', and sez I,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ladies, I hope you're purty well?"</p>

<p>One on 'em kinder got up half way, she was a proper purty
woman, and looked as good natered and kind as a robin red
breast in the spring time, and reached out that harnsome white
hand, and smiled sort of softly, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, we're happy tu see you."</p>

<p>Another harnsome critter in a checkered frock, a rale ginuine
beauty, without paint or whitewash, she gin her leetle foot a
twirl, and was a beginning tu reel off a curchy, so I jest stuck
out my left stomper, and sot the hinge of my back a going for
her; but jest as I was gittin head's up agin and my arms a swinging
back tu their place, I ketched her a looking at t'other one,
and a puckering up them lips of her'n, till they looked like two
red rosberries jest a going to drop off from their bushes. I settled
both hands back in my pockets agin, and stood right up parpendicular,
as a true born American ought tu.</p>

<p>"Marm," sez I, "what do you think of the weather?" and
with that, I jest curled my upper lip and gin her a ginuine grin
from one ear tu t'other, and sez I, "Look a here, marm, if you
want tu do this kinder business up harnsome, take a lesson from
me; I ile the jints of my under jaw every morning. Them screw
larfs ain't good for the mouth, you may be sartin of that."</p>

<p>The critter, she colored all over, till she looked as sweet as a
pina, then a lot of fun bust right into them blue eyes of her'n,
and her pesky leetle mouth begun tu tremble and work itself
about, like a red rosy a trying tu fold itself up into a bud agin;
and then she bust right out into a leetle finefied haw-haw; and
two leetle teenty gals, dressed out in black, they begun to titter
like two pigeons on a gutter&mdash;pesky sweet leetle varmints&mdash;and
a smasher of a woman, that was older than any of 'em, she jined
in and larfed sort of easy and nat'ral, as if she'd fed on nothing
but ripe muskmellons for a hull fortnight; and then the President
he jined in, and we had a fust rate haw-haw, right there in
the cabin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259] </a></span></p>
<p>Jest then, a leetle chap, with an allfired swad of yaller hair a
sticking out all round his head, cum in, and the good natered
lady in the gray dress, she hitched on to the President, and a
great tall chuckle-headed feller, dressed out in frock and trousers
like a boy, with gold buttons a glittering all over his bosom, and
a streak of gold a running across his shoulder, he made a dive at
the harnsome gal in the checkered frock, the consarned overgrown
coot! but I jest then sidled right up with my elbow ready
crooked, and sez I, a looking as perlite as all natur, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arter me is manners for you."</p>

<p>The feller looked mad enough tu eat me hull, without vinegar
or sarse&mdash;but I didn't seem to mind it. The harnsome gal had
clenched her white fingers over my coat sleeve, as loving as a
young grape vine round a black elder bush; and when I git
hitched on to a fust rate gal, all the fellers in creation may go to
old Nick, for what I care. The old Sogers, they mixed in with
us and the fellers with silk rosies, and out we went, on deck and
down stairs. The music, it bust out agin, and one of the fellers
with a silk rose, he yelled out, "Make room for the President!"
so the free-born Americans on deck, they crowded back and
made a lane for us.</p>

<p>"Make room for the President and his sweet," the feller sung
out agin.</p>

<p>Think sez I, "That aint fair now; the gal with the President
is a nice critter as ever lived; but darn me if mine aint sweeter
than his'n, a pesky sight,"&mdash;so I sung out, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Make room for Jonathan Slick and <em>his</em> sweet;" with that I
took a marching step and went down stairs heads up, and with
the gal hanging on my arm, as independent as a cork-screw.
Gaury, but wasn't there a feed, considering it was nothing but a
cold cut&mdash;sich hunks of beef, and ham, and pork, and piles of
bread, and bottles of "the critter," you never sot eyes on, without
it was day arter thanksgiving. We all sot down at one eend
of the table, and afore we'd got a single bite, the doors banged
open, and down cum the free-born citizens from on deck, helter
skelter, higgle-te-pigglety, black coats, red coats, blue, green,
every color on arth, and sogers, spartans, tailors, shoemakers&mdash;every
sort of two-legged animals under 'em, eating away for dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260] </a></span>life, and a drinking like so many house gutters, right afore the
face and eyes of the President and me, with all the harnsome
leetle sweets a setting round us,&mdash;I swan tu man, it eenamost
sot me agin my victuals: and the harnsome gal by my side, she
looked kinder scared, as if she hadn't ought tu be there.</p>

<p>"Try and take a bite, du now!" sez I, a piling some cold
pork on her plate, "it aint a mite rusty, and makes me feel
a'most to hum, it tastes so nat'ral."</p>

<p>She put the leastest mite between them temptin lips, but
didn't seem to eat with a relish yet. "I swan," sez I, a bending
down to take a squint at her face, "I only wish I could git
aboard the sloop, and bring you a prime bunch of young onions.
Wait a minit and I'll try?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," sez the sweet critter, "I'd ruther not&mdash;don't
leave me, Mr. Slick."</p>

<p>"Darn me, if I du&mdash;onions or no onions," sez I, but I felt
kinder disappointed though, for a bunch of white onions, tops
and all, would a ben prime with the cold pork&mdash;howsomever, I
gin in as a feller ought tu, when a gal is in the case; but I didn't
feel a bit satisfied about the stomach. When the President got
up tu go on deck agin, I looked into the gal's eyes, and tried not
tu feel a hungry.</p>

<p>Oh, par, I wish you'd a ben standing on the deck, with us,
when we went up. It was a tarnation harnsome sight; the
water was a blazing with the sun, and a shining around us, all
checkered over with boats, and sloops, and shipping of all sorts,
then right ahead was the hull city of York, steeples, housen, and
wharves, piled together and heaped up with people a swarming
down tu the shore, a hanging over the water, and a climbing up
the masts all along the East and North rivers, like bees in hiving
time. Two allfired big ships sot on the water, right agin the
Battery, with a hull regiment of men, all dressed out in white, a
standing up in the rigging, tu see the President and us cum in.
The hills all round Brooklyn, was kivered thick with folks a
hurraing and a flinging their hats up&mdash;and a leetle island that
lies close up tu York, was chuck full and a running over with
human live stock.</p>

<p>When we got agin the big ships, the men in the riggin flurrished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261] </a></span>their hats, and gin us a thundering loud hurra. The
President he took his hat off, and I and the old yaller chap
boosted him up onto a chair, that everybody might have a good
squint at him. Mr. Curtis wanted tu hold on tu his coat tail,
and make believe boost, but the old yaller chap and I&mdash;we shoved
him off about the quickest.</p>

<p>"Git out," sez I, "git out! if a President of the United
States, can't stand without the help of a pack of office-holders,
he'd better fall tu once. Here's this old revolutionary soger,
and I&mdash;the army, and the people&mdash;if we can't keep him up, he'll
have tu go tu grass that's all!"</p>

<p>But while we was talking, the two ships blazed away with
every darn'd gun in their sides, and the sailors hurraed agin,
and afore we knew it, a hull thunder cloud of hot smoke cum
a pouring over us all&mdash;ca-smash went the chair, and the President
he pitched head for'ard, right amongst the office holders.
The old yaller chap and I shook our heads, and begun to feel a
trifle streaked.</p>

<p>"I'm afeard he's a gone shote," sez I, as the old feller put his
cocked hat on agin.</p>

<p>"A <em>unfortunate accident</em>," says a feller close by.</p>

<p>"Not so unfortunate as you think for," sez Captin Tyler, a
jumping up and a nussing his nose with one hand, "I've had
worse falls than this, and riz agin arter all. Give us another
boost, feller citizens&mdash;I stand ready for a second boost."</p>

<p>The office-holders made believe help him, but Lord a massy!
they hadn't grit enough tu hist a grasshopper out of a bog of
swamp grass; but I and the yaller gineral, though, we sot him
up as good as new, afore half the smoke cleared off.</p>

<p>Jest as all was put tu rights agin, the brass cannon at the eend
of our boat, let off a blast of young thunder. We gin the ship
a fust rate hurra, and the minit we were a done, Captin Doolittle
and the nigger, they got up a small chance of a cheer, and let
off the old gun agin right under our starn. Arter that, we made
a curlecue round both the ships with our music a rolling out and
our flags a flying, and Captin Doolittle he chased right arter
with the red shirts a cutting capers from the bean-poles; and the
leetle nigger, he stood on the bows a rolling his eyes and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262] </a></span>blowing away at Yankee Doodle on a crooked fife like all natur.
I swan tu man, it was enough tu set a feller's patriotism to working
like a beer barrel. We gin the ship another hurra and cut for
the Battery, with Captin Doolittle and the sloop a streaking it
right arter; the guns on the little island they bellowed away at
us as we cut by, and the folks on the Battery, they flung up
their hats and hollered eenamost as loud as the guns that kept
a roaring every minit, till by-am-by in we went ca-smash, right
amongst the trees and a hull gineral training of sogers. The
President and us we walked ashore and went right into Castle
Garden. It was chuck full of feller citizens and sogers, and the
mayor was a waitin for us to cum up; he measured off a hull
bilin of soft soap to the captin, and then the captin he stuck out
his right arm and gin the mayor back as good as he sent, with
a pint cup full over. Then we went out amongst the trees, the
captin he got on tu a horse all finefied off with gold and shiny
leather, and then the leetle boys that hung on the trees as thick
as acorns in the fall, they gin us a cheer, and jest that minit
I see the newsboy a leading my mare right towards me. I
forked over a fourpence-ha'penny and got on tu the critter, tickled
eenamost tu death tu git a chance tu sit down agin.</p>

<p>That mare is clear grit, par, and no mistake; the music, and
the guns, and the shoutin, had sot her blood a bilin, and she
danced about like a two year old colt jest off grass.</p>

<p>I rode through the trainers full chisel arter the President, and
the colt, he cum a kickin up his heels amongst the wimmen and
children as crazy as a bed bug. I pushed in close up tu the captin,
and he and I and the rest on 'em rode along afore the sogers
as crank as you please. But the mare, she didn't seem tu like
the way they pinted them guns at her, and once in a while she'd
kick up and grow a leetle sarcy, and snort right in their faces
like a tin toot-horn about dinner time. When we'd got about
half way through the sogers&mdash;and it seemed as if all creation
had got intu regimentals jest then&mdash;the mare she got anxious
about the colt, and sot up a whinner that a'most shook me off
from her back. I tried tu make her git along, but she only bust
out in a new spot, dug her hoofs close tu the ground and backed
into the crowd till I got wrathy as all natur with her; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263] </a></span>more I paid the gad on, the worse she got, till by-am-by she
stood stock still, a shakin her head, a stompin with her fore foot,
and a yellin arter the colt like a lovesick gal.</p>

<p>The President he was a gitting ahead, and the darn'd coots all
around, begun to larf and poke fun at us, when the colt he cum
a scampering through the trees, and a scattering hull squads of
wimmen, and boys, and babies, every jump, till he ended off in
a crazy caper, all around the mare and me. This pacified the
critter, and arter whinnering over the colt a leetle, she jogged
on as meek as a cosset lamb, and the colt he follered close tu,
till I came up with the captin agin, and then he'd stop every
once in a while, and face about, look right into the sogers' eyes,
so arnest, that they couldn't help but bust out a larfin, if the
President and I was a lookin at 'em.</p>

<p>It was about the greatest show that I ever sot eyes on. The
Battery is one of the harnsomest spots on arth, all kivered with
grass, and chuck full of trees, and a hull army of sogers, some
in brown regimentals, some in green, with yaller feathers, and
some in red, yaller, blue, and all sorts of colors, a wheelin round
under the trees, was enough to make a feller proud of his
country.</p>

<p>When we got to the gate, which opens at the eend of Broadway,
Captin Tyler he got into a carriage, and wanted me to git
in tu, but I was afeard to leave the mare, and so Robert Tyler,
the chap with the yaller hair, we agreed to hitch tackle, and
ride along with one another. A hull army of sogers with their
drums a beating, and colors a flying, went ahead; Robert Tyler
and I, and the colt, and a hull squad of other great men cum
next, and then come on the President with his hat off, and a
bowin to all the winders and stoops as he went along. Wasn't
them winders and ruffs and stoops a sight tu behold! Every
square of glass, and every railing that a critter could hold on to
was kivered with folks. In my hull life, I never see so many
harnsome gals. It seemed as if every man in York, had hung
out a sample of his family, for the fellers to pick and choose
from. I swan tu man, if it didn't seem to me as if all the gals
in creation was a swarming round the President and I, like yaller
butterflies round a mud hole, all on 'em anxious for a smile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264] </a></span>at one or t'other on us. It made the blood kinder tingle all over
me to feel that hull battery of bright eyes a pouring fire down
on us. I raly don't see how the President stood it! He
couldn't, if the crowds of free born citizens that swarmed every
step of the way, layer on layer, hadn't kept him a shakin hands
out of the carriage a'most every step, till he was clear tuckered
out, and a'most wilted down in the carriage, long afore we got
up the <i>Express</i> office. When the news boys see me and the colt,
they sot up a hurra that outdid anything I'd heard since we
come away from the Battery, all the purty gals waved their
hankerchers about, and every winder was jammed full, and all
on 'em a lookin straight at me and Bob Tyler and the colt. So
I lifted my right hand kinder slow, and took off the old bell-crown&mdash;I
drew in the bridle so as to make the mare caper about
right, and made six bows one arter t'other, till my forred near
about touched the old mare's neck.</p>

<p>They gin me three more cheers of the tallest kind, as they say
in York, but when I looked round, there was Bob Tyler with his
hat off, and a shakin that swad of yaller hair about, jest as if <em>our</em>
news boys would cheer him, or any body else, when <em>I</em> was a
goin by!</p>

<p>"That's right, Mr. Slick," sez he, when he see my bell-crown off.</p>

<p>"<em>Par the President</em> must be a'most tired to death, a bowin
and a shakin hands so much, it's quite proper that you and I
should do a little on it for him."</p>

<p>"Wal," think sez I, "if you aint a self-conceited critter, I
don't know who is," but the feller looked as innocent as a lamb,
and I was afeard he'd feel about as sheepish as if I let out on him&mdash;so
I put my bell-crown on agin, with a leetle knock at the top,
for I had to settle the grit somehow, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Wal, Mr. Tyler&mdash;to git on a new subject&mdash;how'll you swap
horses?&mdash;say my mare and colt agin that harnsome critter of
your'n, saddle and bridle thrown in?"</p>

<p>The feller kinder smiled, but didn't answer right off, so I jest
turned about, and leaned one hand on the old mare's cropper,
while I whistled the colt up tu us, and pinted out his harnsome
head and chist, and the clean notion that he has got of flingin
out his legs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265] </a></span></p>
<p>"He's a smart critter, I can tell you," sez I; "and as for the old
mare here, she's worth her weight in silver dollars. Haint got
but one fault on arth."</p>

<p>"And what's that?" sez Mr. Robert Tyler, sez he.</p>

<p>"Why, she's troubled with the <em>botts</em> a leetle, once in a while,
but it aint nothin worth mentionin."</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Tyler he give a start, and he turned as white as
skim milk in the face. Sez he, all in a twitter, sez he, "Don't
mention it, Mr. Slick. My par, the President, wouldn't let a
horse go into his stable that had ever gin symptoms of the botts.
It's an awful disease. Don't mention it to him, for he'd never
git over it if you did!"</p>

<p>"Wal, then, I s'pose we can't trade," sez I. "Think on it agin.
Mebby you'll change your mind to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Hello!" sez I agin. "What's that. Captin Tyler's druv his
carriage right out of the ranks, and is gone fair split down
Broome street."</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Tyler he turned his horse, and he and I and the
colt took arter the President full chisel. We cum up with him
jest as he was a gittin out before the Howard Hotel. He was so
beat out and tuckered down that I raly felt sorry for him; for
arter all that folks say, I believe that he's a good hearted old
chap, and wants to du the thing that's about right, if he could
only be sartin what it was. He couldn't but jest hold up his
head, and had tu go to the Theatre yit. As I was a looking at
him, a notion cum intu my head, and, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captin, jest put on your hat a minit, and drive down to the
sloop&mdash;I've got somethin there that'll make your nose tingle, and
chirk you right up, till you'll be as chipper as a squirrel in the
fall time."</p>

<p>Captain Tyler he got right up, and sez he&mdash;"I'll do anything
on arth that'll make me feel better." "Mr. Robert," sez I, "tell
the gals that we'll come back right off"&mdash;so down we went, I
helped the President into the carriage, and in less than no time
we got out and went aboard the sloop.</p>

<p>Captain Doolittle had gone ashore, and there wasn't nobody
aboard but the leetle nigger. I sent him to the wharf for a
pitcher of cold Croton water, and then I asked the President
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266] </a></span>down into the cabin. It was cleared out, and swept as neat as
a new pin. The table that stood in the middle of the cabin was
scoured off as white as milk, and Captain Doolittle he'd hung up
the checkered curtins that marm made for him, right over the
highest berth, till it looked as temptin as our spare bed. I gin
the Captin a chair, and he sot his hat down on the table, close
by old bell-crown, while I opened a locker and took out a hull
dishfull of doughnuts that marm biled up for me afore I cum
away. Just as I'd sot them on the table, the nigger cum with
the cold water. I took it up tu the locker, and filled in with
vinegar and lasses enough to make it prime switchel, such as
marm mixes up for the workin hands since you took the pledge,
par. When I stirred it up well, and took a swig, to see if it was
the rale critter, I got a tumbler, and arter filling one for the President,
I sot down, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Captin, make yourself to hum, and take hold."</p>

<p>He didn't need much urgin, for the switchel was ginuine stuff,
sweety and yet sort of tart, and cool as a cowcumber, and the
doughnuts beat all natur.</p>

<p>The President hadn't eat more than half a dozen, and had his
tumbler filled about as often, afore he begun to chirk up, and
look as good as new agin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick," sez he, "this is what I call livin," but my mouth
was half full of a middling-sized doughnut, and I had to wash it
down afore I could answer.</p>

<p>"Help yourself, Captin; don't be afeard&mdash;there's enough more
where these cum from," sez I, a swollering the last mouthful.</p>

<p>"Wal, I think I've done purty well," sez he, a stretching hisself
up and putting his hands in his pockets, "I raly begin to
feel like myself agin; that's excellent drink of yourn, aint it,
Mr. Slick?"</p>

<p>"Coolin," sez I, "and ruther toothsome; shall I mix another
pitcher, captin?"</p>

<p>"No, not now," sez he, "but I wish you'd write me out a
receipt."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267] </a></span></p>
<p>"I'll do it," sez I, "and glad of the chance, for darn me if I
haint took a sort of a notion to you; my opinion is that you're
a rale ginuine feller, if them consarned politicians would only let
you be; all you want is a downright honest chap that'll tell you
the truth right out, and that you can trust, he'd be worth a hull
bilin of Whigs, or Loco-focos either."</p>

<p>"But where is he to be found?" sez the President, sort of
melancholy.</p>

<p>"Look a here!" sez I, a flingin one arm over the chair and a
leaning t'other elbow on the table; "look a here!"</p>

<p>The President he sot with both hands in his pockets a looking
right in my face for ever so long, and sez he at last, sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, will you go back with me to the hotel, and sleep
with me to-night? I want to have some talk with you: of course
you'll go with us to the Park Theatre?"</p>

<p>"With all the pleasure in natur," sez I, "and we'd better be
a-goin; take another swig of the pitcher, captin, and stow away
some of the doughnuts in your pockets, they'll be prime at the
Theatre."</p>

<p>The President said he'd eat enough, so as I was a follering up
my own advice, he got up and was a puttin on his gloves, when
he see his own pictur a hanging by Captin Doolittle's berth, and
I could see that he was kinder tickled with it.</p>

<p>"Captin Doolittle aint much of a politician," sez I, "but he
bought that picter because he parsists that it proves you to be
the most consistent President that ever lived, when you veto so
many bills."</p>

<p>"How does my face prove that," sez he, looking sort of
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why," sez I, "he sez that a man that runs so ginerally to
<em>nose</em> can't be expected to say yes when he don't want to."</p>

<p>The President he bust right out a larfin, and with that I took
old bell-crown, and arter sending the nigger to put up the mare
and colt I follered on to the hotel; but it's gittin late and I can't
write any more till next week; but mebby you'll hear from me
then, for the President and I went to the Theatre, and slept together,
and are as thick as three in a bed jest now, and if he
haint no objections I shall write all about it, but 'twill be jest as
it takes my notion whether I send it right on or print it.</p>

<p>I send you my pictur and the captin's tu, but it was engraved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268] </a></span>in a hurry, and aint nigh on so harnsome as either on us; by-am-by
I'll set for another, and then you'll see a chap worth while a
figgering in the Express agin.</p>

<p>JONATHAN SLICK IN NEW YORK.</p>

<p class="chaphead">Jonathan attends the President at the Howard House&mdash;Visits the
Park Theatre with the President and his Handsome Girl&mdash;Goes
with Mr. Robert Tyler to have his Hair Cut at Clairhugh's&mdash;Takes
Refreshments with the Ladies at the Howard House&mdash;Bed-chamber
Scene with the President&mdash;Serenade, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>I begin tu feel a leetle sort of better, but nothing to brag on
yit. I raly believe that I'd a been a gone sucker, if it hadn't
been for the mustard plasters and the onions that Captin Doolittle
kept a filling into me, outside and in, till I can a'most feel
myself sprouting out greener than ever, and twice as strong.
My gracious! when this ere influenza does git hold of a feller,
it aint a critter that you can scare off in a hurry. It's the worst
kind of a Down East cold, double and twisted strong; and if you
don't humor it like a cosset lamb, jest as like as not it ups and
goes off, stuboy, into a galloping consumption; and the worst on
it is, it carries you off with it, whether you will or no.</p>

<p>Let me see; I was a telling you about the President, and how
he seemed tu enjoy the doughnuts and switchel aboard the sloop.
The old chap took tu it like a nussin baby, and if he wasn't clear
grit, and no mistake, arter it, I don't know the symptoms of
prime living.</p>

<p>Wal, we went back to the Howard Hotel, and the President
he jumped out of the carriage as spry as a kitten, and both on
us run up the steps that open out of Maiden Lane, to git rid of
a hull swad of office-holders that was a hurraing at the front
door in Broadway.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269] </a></span></p>
<p>The President he took off his hat, and slicked down his hair
a leetle in the entry-way, and I pulled up my dickey a trifle, and
hauled out a corner of my yaller hankercher, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captin, go ahead, I'm all ready."</p>

<p>We went right intu the harnsomest room that I ever sot eyes
on in my hull life. Nothing that I ever see at the Astor House
was a primin to it. The carpeting was all finefied off, and curlecued
with posies, and green leaves, and morning-glory vines
went a twistifying all over it as nat'ral as life, and all on 'em
seemed kinder tangled up and trying to unsnarl all over the floor,
till it raly seemed like treading on a patch of wild posies, with
the moonshine a streamin over it; you would a'most smell the
roses when a feller sot his foot on a bunch on 'em, they were
pictered out so nat'ral and temptin.</p>

<p>The President, he sidled off to one of the cushioned benches,
and sot down right in a swad of the harnsomest of the gals that
sot in the room. They squeezed together tu make room for him,
and larfed so good natered, and looked all in a twitter they was
so tickled tu git him among 'em; and there I was, eenamost
alone, a standin up parpindicular, and a feelin as streaked as a
pair of old cotton trousers in washing time. That pesky harnsome
critter that wore the checkered frock aboard the boat, she
got nigh agin the door, so when she see me a standin there, she
pinted with that leetle white hand of her'n, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why don't you take a seat, Mr. Slick?"</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, a bowin, "I don't care if I du, jest to oblige
you;" so down I sot, but the cushion give so, that I sprung right
up on eend agin, and when I see it rise up as shiney and smooth
as ever, I looked at her, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you ever!"</p>

<p>"It's elastic," sez she, a puckering up her mouth.</p>

<p>"I don't know the name on it," sez I, "but it gives like an
old friend, so I'll try it agin."</p>

<p>"These cushions are very beautiful and pleasant," sez she.</p>

<p>"Yes," sez I, a spreadin my hankercher over the cushion and
a settin down, "they're as soft and blue as them tarnal sweet
eyes of your'n, but not half so bright."</p>

<p>She kinder larfed a leetle cozy, and begun tu play with a tossel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270] </a></span>that hung to a corner of her seat, and then she went to talkin
with the fat woman that sot t'other side, like all possessed&mdash;the
darned tanterlizin varmint.</p>

<p>The President he was as chipper as a blackbird, with the gals
around him a smiling and a twitterin as tickled as so many trout
round a bait. It raly made my dander rise tu see it, and me a
settin there as lonesome as git out. There, jest afore me on the
wall, was great smashin pictur,&mdash;a rale pen of gold, with a man
and a woman a huggin and kissin, and a lookin into each other's
eyes, right in the middle on it,&mdash;as if there wasn't enough rale
live temptin critters to rile a feller up without tanterlizin him
with picturs tu.</p>

<p>I say, par, did you ever see a checkered adder a charmin a
bird, with his head stuck up in the sun, and kinder slanted a one
side,&mdash;his mouth wide open, and that are leetle forked tongue a
tremblin in the middle on it, as if it was sot to dancin by that
lazy hum, hum, hum, that comes etarnally a bilin up from the
pison critter's throat? Haint you never observed the purty bird,
half scared tu death, and yit a flutterin closer and closer to the
varmint, till by-am-by, she lights right in his jaw, and lies a
twitterin there while he's a swallerin it hull? Wal, par, jest take
away the pison, and you've some idee how I and old bell-crown
come the soft sodder round that gal; but I didn't want to git her
to hankering arter me tu much, for nothin on arth is so likely
to cure a chap of a love-sick fit, as to see the gal a gittin tu strong
a notion arter him; so I gin my fingers another snap, to change
the tune, and tapered of into Old Hundred with a touch of Greenbank,
and that froze her down, eyes, feet and all, in less than no
time.</p>

<p>The Theatre was chuck full of folks, and the minit we went
in, the hull bilin on 'em got up and begun to fling their hats about
and yell agin like all possessed. I tell you what, par, these ere
Yorkers are nigh about tickled tu death to think that I've cum
back agin. The President and I, we both got up and laid our
hands aginst our vest pockets on the left side, and then we begun
tu grin like two whipporwills in a black alder bush, and sot tu
bowin and rollin up our eyes, till they went at it a consarned
sight more fearce than ever. Arter they begun to cool down a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271] </a></span>trifle, the President and I, we sot down on one of the front benches;
so I jest gin the harnsome gal a wink to set down close tu
t'other side, and then the hull on 'em begun tu pile in, till we
cut about as harnsome a dash as a'most anybody need tu see.</p>

<p>The mayor, he was a goin tu set down by the President, but
when he see me, of course he gin away, and sot on t'other seat.</p>

<p>Jest then the curtain cum down ca-chunk, and the folks all riz
and gin me three cheers that made the blood bile in my heart
like maple sap in a sugar kittle. Then a leetle, lank, office-seekin
chap sticks hisself up in the back seats, and yelled out, "Three
cheers for the President."</p>

<p>But lord a marcy, cheers aint to be hauled out of a crowd of
free-born citizens like fish from a mill pond. Two or three mean
looking shotes like him squealed out "Hurra!" but that bait
wasn't temptin enough for known fish. I didn't want to make
the President feel bad, nor jealous, nor nothin, so I jest gin old
bell-crown a whirl, and hollered out, "Three cheers for <em>my</em>
friend, the captin."</p>

<p>Gaury, didn't they let into it then! the ruff with all its picturs
and curlecues seemed a liftin right up from the walls, hats
and hankerchers streamed out; and sich a blast of human thunder
aint heerd every night at the Park Theatre.</p>

<p>"That'll du," sez I, a sinkin old bell-crown, and letting myself
off in a bow like an iled jack-knife. "That'll du. Now,
captin, I guess we'd better go hum."</p>

<p>"But I've got to go to the Chatham Theatre yit," sez the
President, a takin up his hat. "The Democracy, the Democracy,
you know, Mr. Slick, that must be our fust consideration."</p>

<p>"You aint a goin, Mr. Slick?" sez the harnsome gal, a lookin
with them two eyes right into mine, and a clinchin them ere
white fingers over the edge of old bell crown.</p>

<p>"I ruther guess not," sez I, a droppin my yaller hankercher
over that pesky white hand, for it looked so temptin that I was
afeard the President would want to git hold on it, and somehow
a President al'ers does purty much as he's a mind to with the
gals, except now and then one that's got a right idee of her place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272] </a></span></p>
<p>"Wal," sez I, "captin, if you're detarmined to tackle in with
that arnimal that you jest mentioned, make up your mind to cut
your own fodder. I go for human natur in gineral&mdash;the best
part of natur I take to be the wimmen folks&mdash;so, if you'd jest
as lives, I'll stay and go hum with the gals."</p>

<p>With that, Captin Tyler and the mayor, and the chaps with
the silk rosies went off; but Robert Tyler and I jest hitched ontu
the wimmen critters, and took them hum to the Howard Hotel.
The landlord, he sent us some drink that was enough to make
your eyes water, besides a great dish of pine-apples sliced up,
sugared off and with wine poured all over 'em, that he sot right
under the glass dish full of fire, where they lay yaller and shiny
enough to tempt a tee-totaler to break his pledge. The wimmen
they all drawed up round the table, and while they were laying
into the eatables and drinkables, I jest sidled round to the harnsome
gal and took one of marm's doughnuts out of my pocket,
and I slid it into her hand. I gin her a wink, and, sez I,</p>

<p>"Keep dark, I don't want tu be mean, nor nothin; I haint got
enough to go all round."</p>

<p>She was so tickled that she turned red all over, and eenamost
larfed out; but she took the hint and rolled the doughnut up in
her hankercher, not to make the rest jealous.</p>

<p>Jest then, I slipped out and run down tu the sloop, for I felt a
dry agin, and them pine-apples made me feel sort of womble-cropped
about the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Here I am agin, safe and sound, large as life, and chipper as a
grasshopper on a high rock in a sunshiny day. I tell you what,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273] </a></span>a few ginuine huskings to hum, with purty gals to put the music
in a feller's elbows, as he strips the husks off from the corn, is
jest the sort of occasions to put the grit into a feller from top to
toe&mdash;jest top them off with an apple cut or so, sich as we had to
our house when you and marm cut about amongst the gals and
the young chaps, like two spring colts jest let out to grass; and
taper the hull off with a week sich as I had a ropin onions with
Judy White, with her pesky red pouters a one side, and two or
three prim Weathersfield gals on t'other a turning their good natured
eyes at a feller every string, till his heart is a cuttin pigeon
wings agin his ribs to the music of their larf&mdash;jest let a chap get
used to that sort o'pastur, and consarn me, if it don't do more towards
making a ginuine man of him than a hull etarnity of York
life, where every other man and gal you meet have got their
hearts so tarnally used up, that they have to lean agin their back
bones to rest more than half the time, and likely as not get sound
to sleep at that.</p>

<p>The old sloop jest hit the nail on the head, and hauled into
Peck Slip the night arter Mr. Macready, a smashin actor from
the old country, got to the Park Theatre, where he's been a acting
out things that'd make your hair stand right up an eend eenajest
to see it. I tell you what, he's a hull team and a horse to
let&mdash;no mistake in that.</p>

<p>Did you ever see a race horse up on eend for a run, with his
neck curled over like an ox bow, and his skin shinen like a junk
bottle? Did you ever look into the critter's eyes, and see the
fire dancing through the black?&mdash;arnimal lightning, every darned
spark on it. If you've seen that are, then you've got some idee
of the allfired smashin critter that my arm was eenamost girting
afore I took a squint at her face.</p>

<p>Wal, she squinched a trifle and gin a leetle start, and then gin
me a look with them etarnal long big eyes that made me a'most
jump on eend, and yit I sot like a great gawk a staring right
intu her face, jest as if I hadn't no marners. Quill wheels and
cheese presses! wasn't that critter something worth while! sich
lips&mdash;red as a blood beet, and shiny as a harnful of wintergreen
berries! Consarn it, if ther'd been a honey bee in the theatre,
he couldn't a kept from lighting right between 'em; and if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274] </a></span>didn't find the breath as sweet agin as all the honey he ever
stole from a clover top, I must a been darndly cheated by the
looks on 'em&mdash;that's jest it. Her neck, and that great broad forred
of her'n, looked sort brown and slick, alike a hazlenut jest
afore it rattles from the shuck; and I never see a crow a flying
in the hot sun so black and shiny, as the thick swad of hair that
hung braided and twistified up with gold chains, rale ginuine gold,
all round that harnsome head of her'n. I swan tu man, she was
the fust gal that ever made Jonathan Slick feel as if he wasn't
tu hum in good company. Our black colt, with his taperin limbs,
that soft shiny mane, and them eyes that seemed to ketch fire
when the sun strikes 'em&mdash;is about as much like a common cider
mill horse, as she is like the generality of wimmin folks. She
was eenajest as tall as I be, and big enough every way to match&mdash;a
rale downright sneezer of a gal, that a'most took away my
breath every time my eye ketched her'n: and consarn me, if that
wasn't every two seconds while I sot there.</p>

<p>Wal, there we sot and sot, till the curtin right afore us came
down ca-chunk agin the floor, and all the folks riz up as if it
was time tu be a goin. The gal got up, took the bottle and hankercher
in one hand, and seemed tu be kinder lookin around for
something. I was jest a crookin my elbow, and had eenamost
said, "Shall I have the pleasure to see you hum marm?" as we
do at singin school, when a feller that had been settin right behind
us riz up and stuck out his hand as nat'ral as git out.</p>

<p>The gal kinder gin a turn, and while she made bleeve pin her
shawl, chucked a piece o' paper into my hand, and put the consarned
little hand that I'd been a nussing in mine, right through
that tall chap's arm, and went off as if nothing was the matter.
I turned round like a great gawk, and took arter em. I jest
ketched one squint at them tarnal black eyes and at a swad o'
hair that stuck out on his upper lip, like a gray cat's whiskers,
and then I found myself standing, like any other darned coot, all
alone under a street lamp, a tryin to cypher out the leetle finefied
words writ out on that piece o' paper. Arter a good deal
of extra spellin I found out the meanin, and that was an invite
to come and see that gal in the morning, at a house
in &mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275] </a></span></p>
<p>Wal, I did the paper up, put both hands in my trousers pockets,
and arter lookin at myself from top to toe, sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jonathan Slick, you must be a consarned sight harnsomer
chap than ever I took you to be, that's sartin."</p>

<p>Wal, I couldn't ketch a wink of sleep all night, but kept up a
tarnal thinkin about that gal; and there lay Captin Doolittle a
snorin away in the berth right above me, like a tin peddler's toot-horn
run crazy. I swan, it was as much as I could du to keep
from gettin up and chokin the varmint. Turights the daylight
cum a sneakin intu the cabin as lazy as ever you see daybreak
come on; and jest arter the sun got up, Captin Doolittle begun
to stir his stumps about breakfast. He and I and the little nigger
sot down, but I felt kinder peaked and couldn't hoe my row a
bit; so the Captin and the nigger did extra duty, and stowed
away for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par:</span></p>

<p>Wal, as I was sayin, I pulled foot down one of them streets
that run off kinder catecorned by the Park, till I cum right agin
the house pinted out in the paper which that harnsome gal had
gin me. I kinder cut across the street and stood over agin the
house, detarmined tu take a sort o' observation afore I sot my
foot inside the doorway. It was an allfired harnsome consarn,
with one story piled atop of t'other, till you could count four
rows of winders, besides a row of young ones, stuck right in tu
the edge of the ruff. A lot of stone steps run up tu the front
door, and an iron fence twistified and curlecued round the edges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276] </a></span>run along each eend. The winders all on 'em had green slats
shut over 'em, the door follered the fashion, and the hull consarn
seemed tu be shut up agin winter.</p>

<p>Wal, I cut across the street and went straight up the steps.
There was a great chunk o' silver sot intu a kind of a silver sarser
nailed agin the door post, and with a name writ round the
edge on it. Arter giving the chunk a sneakin pull, to be sartin
it would give and meant somethin, I gin it an allfired jerk&mdash;and
turights there was a tinklin and ringin inside, as if an old wether
with a fust rate bell on, had took to scootin over the house.</p>

<p>I hadn't more'n got my hand off the chunk, when the green
slats swung open jest as easy, and a yaller nigger stood inside a
eyeing me from top tu toe, as if he had a sort of hankerin arter
some human arnimal, but didn't think me jest good enough tu
eat hull without considerable sarse.</p>

<p>"How do you du," sez I, as mealy as a pink eyed potater jest
out o' the pot&mdash;"How are all the folks this mornin?&mdash;purty
smart I reckon."</p>

<p>The coot stared and kinder shook the two great swads o' curly
hair that stuck out over each side of his head; and arter lookin
back intu the house, then up the street, and then agin at me, sez
he, "What du you want?" sez he.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, a divin both hands down to where my pockets
ought to a'been, but eenamost keelin head over heels with the
dive I gin without finding bottom&mdash;"I seem tu surmise that I
want tu see some body a trifle more like folks than you seem tu
be&mdash;so I guess I'll walk in."</p>

<p>With that I gin the chap a shove with one of my mudgrapplers,
and walked right intu the long entry-way, as crank as a
militia trainer with his regimentals on.</p>

<p>"What's your name and who do you want?" sez the yaller
nigger kinder wrothy, and a shakin that swad o' curly hair at
me like a darned great sun flower in a foggy storm.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "you ought tu go Down East and learn to ask
questions. If your tongue was only half as greasy as your face
now, you could a done it as slick agin. I aint got no name tu
speak on, and all I want o' you is jest tu tell the harnsome critter
that lives here, that I'm on hand, a waitin down here as spry
as a cricket, and about as arnest tu see her agin as ever a chap
was."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277] </a></span></p>
<p>The chap he kinder eyed me askew. Fust he took a squint at
my puffy trousers, then at old bell crown, and then at me all over.</p>

<p>"You can't be the gentleman that she told me to let in," sez
he; "does Miss Sneers expect you?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I kinder reckon she does," sez I.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez the feller, lookin sort o' unsartain, "jest step intu
this room and I'll go and see."</p>

<p>"That's a leetle more like folks," sez I, a followin the chap
intu a room at one eend of the entry-way, where I sot down
with old bell crown over my knees, and took a squint round. It
was kinder dark, for them between slats shut out the light; but
I could see that the room hadn't been fixed up since over night.
Two of the chairs lay keeled up on the carpet&mdash;the kiver was a
slidin off from the table a'most tu the carpet, and slopped over
with wine that wasn't dry yit&mdash;a decanter with a trifle o' wine,
or per'aps brandy, stood on the table where the cloth had left it
bare, and an allfired purty wine glass lay on the harnsome carpet
broke to smash; and round under the table and close around my
chair was a hull squad of playin cards, a'most new, as if somebody
had got beat a playin high-low-jack and the game, and
flung the hull bilin down in a huff. I'd jest picked up two or
three of the cards, when the yaller nigger turned back and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"It aint of no use&mdash;I can't tell my mistress who wants tu see
her, if you wont give me your name, or a card."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "if you must have one or t'other, there's a card&mdash;now
git out, and don't let me see that consarned yaller face
agin till it's wanted."</p>

<p>With that I handed over the jack-o'-spades; he turned his
great sarser eyes, fust on the leetle feller that sot stuck up on the
card, and then agin at me, as if he didn't know what tu make
on't. There was no satisfy in him, I could see that, but I'd
begun to get tired o' waitin, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Wal, there's the card, and a harnsome one tu&mdash;my name is
Jonathan Slick of Weathersfield&mdash;my father is a Squire and a
Deacon of the Church&mdash;my mother was Jerusha Pettebone&mdash;my &mdash;&mdash; but
darn me, if you aint satisfied now, you consarned pryin
shote, you may go tu grass, and the harnsome gal with
you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278] </a></span></p>
<p>The feller cut stick afore I'd half done, and cum back a bowin
and a scrapin, as if he'd got a set of new jints while he was a
goin up stairs.</p>

<p>"My mistress wants tu know if you're the gentleman that she
saw at the theatre last night."</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I, a flingin down the ten spot o' clubs and the
ace o' diamonds, for somehow I jest didn't like the touch of the
varmints&mdash;"jest so!"</p>

<p>"Walk up stairs," sez he, a bowin eenamost tu the ground.</p>

<p>"Wal, I don't care if I du," sez I, follerin the chap.</p>

<p>I took off old bell crown and riled up my curls with a leetle
flourish o' fingers amongst the thickest on 'em, as I went up
stairs&mdash;then I kinder shook up the pletes of my trousers, and
pulled out the eend of my yaller hankercher, as I went along
behind the buff colored nigger.</p>

<p>I swan tu man, Par, it was like walkin through a footpath
kivered over with meadow grass and wild posies, as I went up
the stairs, all carpeted off and a shinin with bars of gold. Jest
at the top stood a black figger, a'most as large as life and all but
naked, a holdin one finger tu his lips and with a lamp in t'other
hand, that seemed as if it had burnt itself out, for there wasn't
any ile in it, and the wick was sooty as a nigger's eye lashes.</p>

<p>Wal, I follered on intu another entry-way, where another figger
stood, as white as if it had been cut out of a fust rate cheese
curd. It had one foot up, as if it was a darncin, one arm was
flung over its own head, and both its pesky leetle hands was
chuck full of posies, that looked as if they'd been planted in a
snow bank and watered with new milk, afore that harnsome
half dressed, indecent figger had found 'em. She looked like a
ginuine purty gal froze tu death for the want of kiverin.</p>

<p>Wal, while I was a lookin at the poor critter, that yaller
nigger he opened the door and stood a flurishin his hand about,
jest as our minister does when he dismisses meetin, and is tu
allfired lazy tu use both hands tu once.</p>

<p>I went by the varmint and there I stood stock still in the door
way a starin about like a stuck calf. I swan, Par, I never sot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279] </a></span>eyes on any thing that could shake a stick at that are room in
my born days. The floor was all spread off with a carpet, like a
meadow that slants tu the fust spring sun when the grass is a
springin up, and sot off thick with dandelions, buttercups and
clovertops; and I swan tu man, there was something in the room
that smelt just about as sweet.</p>

<p>The room wasn't over large, and a whoppin winder eenamost
took up one eend on't. Yet it was kinder dark for all that, for
a hull harvest of shiny silk, as thin as a locust's wing, and sort
a rosy colored, like a gal's cheek jest arter a chap has kissed it&mdash;was
kinder tumblin down the winder in winrows turned lengthwise,
one arter t'other, till the hull was grabbed up in one alfired
swad, and ketched back in a great hook all of solid gold, that
glistened like a lookin-glass frame when the fire light ketches it
fair.</p>

<p>There wasn't but two chairs in the room, and they seemed tu
be made out o' solid gold tu, stuffed down with shining silk
figered off with posies redder than the winder silk, and yet kinder
like it. There was a bench agin the winder, standin on
chunks o' gold cut out like a lion's paw, and that tu was all
cushioned off with shiny silk like the chairs, and on the back on
it, right agin the wall, two pillars were stuck up, all kivered over
with posies that looked good enough tu smell on. Right agin
the door was the harnsomest consarn that I ever sot eyes on. It
was a kind of a round table cut in tew in the middle, dressed up
in white and ruffled off with harnsome lace, like a gal when she
means tu cut a dash. A lookin glass stood on it sot in a gold
frame work, curlecued off like a great vine, with the golden
grapes a bustin out all over it, and sort a droppin down over the
glass. I snum, if it wasn't a sight tu behold! There was a finefied
gold watch about as big as a ninepence, a lyin on the table,
and some leetle red morocco boxes, with a newfangled pitcher
pictured off tu kill, chuck full of ginuine roses and green leaves,
that looked as if they'd that minit cum off from the bushes.</p>

<p>There was one thing more a standin up in the corner that beat
all I ever did see. It was an allfired overgrown candlestick a
standin on legs, and eenamost as tall as I be. That tu, seemed
to be of solid gold, curlecued off with little picters. On the top
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280] </a></span>was a great golden sarser, and what chawed me up was a stream
o' smoke that ris from the sarser, and kinder spread all over the
room, jest enough to let a chap know that there was a fire somewhere
about. Jest behind the whoppin candlestick was the figger
of a critter, sort o' half bird and t'other half baby, the cunninest
varmint that I ever did see. The wings grew out of his
chubby shoulders, and the pesky little scamp seemed tu be a larfin
at me through the smoke all the while that he made believe
that he was a droppin somethin down intu the gold sarser. The
critter was as white as a tomb stun; but if it hadn't kept still, I
should eenamost thought it was alive. There I stood bendin
for'ard, with my mouth kinder opened and old bell crown between
both hands, a lookin at that little varmint, and there he
was a'most winken at me, when somebody said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Walk in Mr. Slick,&mdash;pray walk in!"</p>

<p>I gin a jump and dropped old bell crown, for it seemed tu me
as if the flyin baby had spoke; but in stoopin tu pick up old bell
crown agin, I kinder turned round; and there, on a bench cushioned
off with silk, like the one I've told you on, sot the gal I'd
seen at the theatre last night; but oh, get out! more than as
harnsome agin. She was all dressed out in a white gown, that
hung kinder slimsy from that purty neck, till it eenajest kivered
the pesky leetle feet that lay on a footstool like two black squirrels
asleep together. The cloth that her dress was made on, was
so thin that I could a seen her arms through clean tu the wrist, if
the sleeves hadn't been made so full, that every time she moved
the hull arm got more than half unkivered. I swan, it made me
ketch my breath, when she kinder half ris and reached out that
are soft hand, a smilin all the time as if she was tickled eenajest
tu death tu see me.</p>

<p>I gin her hand a leetle mechin shake, and turned round tu set
down in one of the chairs, for I couldn't help but feel a trifle
streaked amongst all that heap o' silk and gold. But before
I was quite sot down she settled back aginst the pillar, and
whilst she let one foot drop from the stool, she fixed t'other pillar
agin the wall; and while she was a pattin the posies on it
with her hand, she lifted them tarnal black eyes and gin me a
smile that had more than the sweetness of a hull bilin of sugar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281] </a></span>in it; and there she sot with that hand kinder stuck intu the
pillar yet.</p>

<p>Now, Par, you don't think I was shote enough tu set down in
the big chair arter that, do you? I guess I wheeled round, about
the quickest, and sot down so close by that harnsome critter,
that I could feel her breath on my hair; and yit, I sot as fur
off as I could, and close on the edge of the bench, but it was
orfal short, and I had tu set close any how; but oh gauly, didn't
my fingers tingle. There was that leetle hand, as soft and
white as a snowball, a lyin among the posies worked on that
pillar right behind me, and I hadn't but jest tu lean back, and
that are arm would a been a'most round me. But there I sot,
close on the edge, all in a flusterfication, fust a lookin at that are
hand, then at her smilin face, and then agin at old bell crown,
and so over agin. Arter I'd sot about a minit, I hitched back a
trifle, and gin a kind o'skeery squint at her&mdash;she was eenajest
larfin. With that, I gin another hitch, and looked right straight
at old bell crown, as if I wanted tu eat it. The harnsome critter
didn't seem tu rile up any, so I jest dropped bell crown,
dived tu pick it up agin, and riz right up parpendicler agin the
pillar. I could feel the leetle hand a movin on the pillar agin my
back, like a chip squirrel in its nest; but think says I, you'r ketched
this time, any how, and I guess you may as well lie still. With
that, I turned my head sort of a slow, and larfed a leetle, jest
enough tu show my teeth round the edges, and sez I,</p>

<p>"How do you du marm?"</p>

<p>Did you ever see a spring begin tu gurgle and shine up all tu
once, when you've parted the peppermint that grows over it, and
let in the broad daylight on the water? If you have, per'aps
you have some idea how consarned harnsome the smile was that
cum bustin all over that gal's face, a dimpling up them pesky red
lips, and a dancin through them great black eyes. I could see the
tantelizen critter a bitin them plump lips of hern, to keep from
snickerin out in my face; so I put on a leetle extra grin myself,
for I'm a hull team at larfin, and a hoss tu let, when I once
begin. By-am-by, sez she, as well as she could git it out,
sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you enjoy yourself in town, Mr. Slick."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282] </a></span></p>
<p>"I reckon I du jest now," sez I, "quite a considerable deal,
and upwards."</p>

<p>With that she sort a smiled agin, and somehow that other
leetle hand in her lap kinder crept along under the loose slimsey
sleeve, as if it wanted tu get better acquainted with mine. My
mudgrappler didn't object tu be introduced.</p>

<p>"It's orful pleasant weather, for time o'year," sez I, and my
hand kinder crept along towards hern a mite.</p>

<p>"Very," sez she, a looking at the tall candlestick as soft as
summer butter; "very."</p>

<p>"I also kinder like tu go into the woods in the fall, and see
the trees a turnin all sorts o' colors, red and blue and yaller; and
see the chesnuts, jest ripe enough tu drop from there prickly
shucks, and hear the but'nuts a ratlin down tu the dry leaves.
Oh, gauly! I wish you and I was there now, if it was ony
jest tu watch the chip-munks and gray squirrels a carrying off
the nuts in their mouths and fore paws. Did you ever see a
harnsome black squirrel, with a shagbark between his whiskers,
a hoppin among the trees, arter they're stript more'rn half
naked by the frost?"</p>

<p>Then my fingers begun to travel agin like anything.</p>

<p>"Yes," sez she, "I love a pet squirrel dearly."</p>

<p>By this time my hand had got tu the eend of its journey and
put up.</p>

<p>"Harnsome critters, aint they," sez I, a'most out o'breath, I
was so skeared. "Captin Doolittle has got a rale sneezer down
at the vessel, as black as git out, his tail curls up over his side
like the feather in a gal's bonnet, and he's got an eye as bright
and sharp as if it had been cut out o' yourn. I'll hook it from
the old coot, cage and all, and bring it up tu you, if you've a
notion tu it, consarn me if I don't."</p>

<p>"You're very kind," sez she.</p>

<p>"Oh, you git out!" sez I; "that aint a primin tu what I mean
tu du, if you and I can only agree tu draw in the same tacklin.
I aint mean as some chaps that I know on&mdash;nobody ever ketched
me a halving a long nine, or askin a gal tu pay her own shot
when she went a slayin with me&mdash;ask Captin Doolittle, if you
don't believe <em>me</em>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283] </a></span></p>
<p>The critter looked up and kinder smiled agin so darned winnin,
that I histed her hand tu my lips, and gin it a nibble afore I knew
what I was about. She seemed tu try tu pull it away, and turned
her head so that I couldn't see her face.</p>

<p>"You aint mad nor nothin?" sez I, a lettin go her hand.
"I swan tu man, you looked so darned sweet I couldn't help
it."</p>

<p>She got up and went tu the table that was dressed off so, and
smelt of the posies on it, and then she cum back agin and sot
down as good natured as a pussey cat; but she'd put me in such
a tantrum, for fear I'd made her mad, that I didn't know what
tu say next; so there I sot, a feelin streakeder and streakeder
every minit; but arter a while I bust out agin&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speakin of the woods," sez I, "aint the maple trees harnsome?
Did you ever see the leaves when they're jest a turnin
red, a kinder tremblin on the limbs, as if every one on 'em was
kinder afraid of fallin off? I've seen 'em over night as green as
some of these country chaps when they fust come tu York; and
then agin in the mornin, as red as your lips; and a'most as bright
when the sun shines on 'em."</p>

<p>I could see them lips begin to pucker up agin, as if they wanted
to give me a chance of judgin. So I kept on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swan," sez I, "sometimes it seems to me as if the sugar
had stuck up through the leaves and turned 'em red, they look
so pesky sweet. Speakin o' that, du you love maple sugar?"</p>

<p>"Very much," sez she.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, "next time I cum I'll bring you an allfired hunk,
see if I don't."</p>

<p>Jest then, the chap that I'd seen at the theatre with her the
night afore, opened the door and cum straight in. I eenamost
jumped on eend and dropped her hand, that some how or other
had got intu mine agin, as if it had been a hot chesnut.</p>

<p>But the chap only looked around, and made a sort of a slidin
bow, and shet the door agin.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, all in a twitter, for my heart had riz right up
intu my mouth; "I guess I'll be goin."</p>

<p>"So soon?" sez she, a liftin them eyes sort o' mournful.</p>

<p>I wilted right down agin, like a cabbage plant in the sun.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284] </a></span></p>
<p>"And who may that chap be," sez I, for I begun tu feel ugly
about the heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's only my brother," sez she, "never mind him. Are
you fond of music, Mr. Slick?"</p>

<p>"I guess I be," sez I. "When the chorister is gone, I al'ers
lead the singin at meetin tu hum."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard Castellan?" sez she.</p>

<p>"No," sez I, "I don't know as ever I've heard that instrument,
but I'm great on the bas-viol, and could beat all natur on
the toot horn when I was a leetle shaver, not more than knee
high to a toad."</p>

<p>Consarn the critter, I couldn't speak but what that pesky mouth
of hern would brighten and pucker up.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go with me and hear her this evening?"
sez she. "We shall hear some fine music."</p>

<p>"If you'll only talk tu me there can't be a doubt on it," sez I,
a bowin.</p>

<p>"Then you will go?" sez she.</p>

<p>"I reckon I will," sez I, "twice over if you want me tu, and
tickled to death with the chance."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez she, "I'll be ready at half past seven."</p>

<p>"You'll find me on hand," sez I; "and now I guess I must be
a goin."</p>

<p>With that I took up old bell crown, and arter makin a prime
bow, was a goin out; but I happened tu think what a coot I'd
been, and turned back.</p>

<p>"I swan," sez I, "I'd a'most forgot tu ask what you wanted
tu see me for."</p>

<p>I snum, it seemed as if the maple leaves I'd been a talking of
had been flung, a hull swad on 'em into her face, she turned so
red; but afore she could speak I heard that chap a comin agin;
so I made her a low bow, but sudden, like a jack-knife opened
and shet in a hurry, and I cut for the sloop agin.</p>

<p class="chaphead">The Gambling House&mdash;Jonathan is taken in with Cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Par</span>:</p>

<p>I've tried to write tu you agin and agin since my t'other letter,
but I felt so dreadful bad, there was no makin it out, all I could
du. I've been dreadful sick, and about the darndest melancholy
critter that ever sot up an eend in bed.</p>

<p>I own it eenamost kills me to begin, but the truth will out
some time or other; and a feller that aint ashamed to du wrong,
must be a snakin shote if he can't pick up courage tu own up tu
the truth, like a man. It's a tough job, though, to own that
you've been made a darn'd coot, and a leetle wus than that&mdash;but
all I've got to du is to grin and bear it. I was a tellin you
that Miss Sneers gin me an invite to supper. I slicked up and
went, nigh about dark, a feelin sort a streaked, I couldn't tell why,
and a thinkin of Judy White all the way; that pesky harnsome
critter had riled up my feelins so desperately that I raly hadn't
known which eend my head was on&mdash;but, somehow, as I went
along, Judy seemed close by me, with her hand on my arm, kinder
holdin me back; and once I was eenamost tempted tu turn
back, and never think o' this York gal agin on arth. I swow, I
raly believe the tears stood in my eyes when I went up the steps&mdash;for
I couldn't keep from thinkin of hum all I could du, and it
seemed jest as if you and marm were a holdin family prayers,
and all for my sake, jest then. I do believe, Par, that the spirits
of live folks that love you are as likely agin to haunt a feller
when he's in danger as them of dead people. Wal, I rung the
door-bell kinder loth, for I hadn't felt very chipper all day, and,
somehow, thinkin of hum and sich things gin me a kind of timersome
feelin. The buff nigger was on hand in no time. He
swung open the door, and stood a bowin and a shakin that etarnal
swad of hair till I got clear into the entry-way. I was a goin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286] </a></span>right up stairs, but the nigger he opened a side door, and says
he, "walk in."</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I, and I went through the door inter a room
that was sot off tu kill with all sorts o' notions and foreign fixins.
The winders were shut up close, and kivered from top tu bottom
with a hull Niagara of red silk. The benches and settees and
chairs shone and glistened all around, and overhead was one of
them concerns of fire and chink glass, a blazin and flashing round
us till it seemed as if the ruff overhead was made of solid gold.
The wall were kivered all over with picters&mdash;them golden frames
was all cirlicued off, and shone out dreadful harnsome, I can tell
you. Right under that heap of swinging glass, and jest where
the fire felt strongest, there was a table about as large round as
marm's cheese tub, and kivered over with a red cloth, all figured
off that fell clear to the carpet, and looked sort o' rich, like a pile
of winter apples heaped afore a cider mill.</p>

<p>Two or three chaps sot afore the table, larfin and a talkin together,
while they kinder tilted back the chairs they sot in, and
seemed to make themselves tu hum all over.</p>

<p>I looked around for Miss Sneers, but she wasn't there yit, and
the chaps by the table didn't seem tu know that I was standin
there, and a lettin off my prime bows all for nothin. But jest
as I was a goin to back out, a feller that lay on one of these new-fangled
settees that have an arm chair at each eend, and a bench
in the middle all cushioned off with red silk, he kinder riz up,
and I see it was the chap that waited on Miss Sneers at the
theatre the first time I ever saw her. He cum for'ard on seein
me, and a lookin eenamost tickled tu death tu think I'd cum. He
told the chaps by the table who I was, and they got up tu, and
was in a mighty takin about my bein there. I sot down on a
chair, and histed one leg top of t'other, and begun tu teeter my
right foot sort of independent, and looked about for Miss Sneers.
She wasn't there jest then, and I begun to feel rather awkward.
But the man that I'd seen with her at the theatre, he sot down
close by me, and begin to talk as chipper as if he'd known me a
hundred years. I hadn't had a good chance tu look at the feller
before in arnest, but now as he sot agin me, I gin him considerable
observation. He was a tall, harnsome chap, with hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287] </a></span>as thick and black as midnight. His eyes were black tu, and as
sharp as darningneedles, but you never could ketch them a lookin
at you more'n a minute at a time&mdash;they al'ers shied when a
feller looked right straight into them. His voice was as soft as
a mealy potater, and he kinder slid up to you across the room
like a gray cat, and seemed tu be jest about as innocent. He begun
tu talk about farming, and the price of produce in York, jest
as cozey as git out, and seemed tu be right tu hum on any subject
that cum up. The other chaps they jined in' and laid on a
considerable soft sodder about my letters in the Express&mdash;but
they did it slick, I can tell you, smoothed it down nice and ily,
till you couldn't jest tell exactly whether it was soft sodder or
not.</p>

<p>Arter a few minutes, Miss Sneers she cum in&mdash;I felt my heart
jump intu my mouth, and the blood bile up over my face, like
hot flip when the iron is put in. It seemed tu me, as if she never
did look so harnsome afore&mdash;her frock was all blue shiny velvet,
as bright as a damson plum&mdash;that ere round neck so pesky white,
hadn't no kiverin on, but a leetle finefied gold chain, and another
gold chain was tangled up with the great swad of hair that was
twistified up on the nap of her neck. She kinder slid intu the
room sort of easy, jest like a trout sailin along the bottom of a
brook&mdash;her cheeks looked as fresh as a full blown rosy, and her
mouth, the darned provokin thing, looked jest like a bunch of
ripe strawberries, ready tu drop from the stems.</p>

<p>She kinder bowed tu the chaps that sot by the table, and then
cum right up tu where I stood with both her hands out tu once,
as if she was tickled all over tu see me agin.</p>

<p>Both them little white hands wasn't more than one handful for
me, and I wasn't in no very great hurry tu let go, when I once
got a good grip at 'em&mdash;she didn't seem tu mind my havin 'em,
but sot down right between me and her brother, and there she
sot a smilin right intu my eyes and a askin so arnest arter my
helth that I couldn't but jest speak, my heart riz so. The critter
really seemed tu have took a notion tu you, and marm. She
was dreadful arnest tu know if I'd hearn from you, and how you
stood the cold weather, and then consarn me! if she didn't ask
how Captin Doolittle did, jest as if the old coot had a ben her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288] </a></span>own Par. By-am-by she bent over, and kinder whispered tu
me, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must go and speak tu the gentlemen there&mdash;you make me
forget everything but yourself."</p>

<p>With that she gin my fingers a leetle grip and went up tu the
table.</p>

<p>"You seem dull," sez she, "supposin you take a game at cards
till supper is ready."</p>

<p>"If Mr. Slick hain't no objection" sez her brother, a lookin at
me kinder anxious. "His father's a deacon you know."</p>

<p>They all turned on their chairs, and looked at me, as if a man
that didn't like cards must a have been brought up in the woods.
It made me feel kinder streaked&mdash;so sez I, "oh never seem tu
mind me, I aint a skeered at a pack of cards, if my Par is."</p>

<p>"Du you ever play," sez Miss Sneers, a smilin on me like a
June sun.</p>

<p>"Wal," sez I, speakin up crank, "I haint done much at it,
since I was a little shaver, and used tu play high-low-jack and
the game, with one of our workmen in Par's barn tu hum, but I
was a considerable of a sneezer at it in them days, I recon."</p>

<p>Miss Sneers's brother, sez he, "Wal then, supposin you take a
hand here."</p>

<p>I felt kinder bad at the idea of touching cards arter promisin
you not tu, Par, when you ketched me at it and gin me that allfired
lickin in the barn&mdash;but Miss Sneers stood right afore me,
shuffling a bran new pack o' cards in them little white hands and
a lookin at me so cunnin that I couldn't stand it&mdash;yet I felt sort
o' loth and held back.</p>

<p>"I'm afeared I've eenajest forgot how," sez I; a loungin
back.</p>

<p>"Oh never mind," sez one of the chaps in a red and green
vest, and with checkered trousers on, "Miss Sneers will show
you how."</p>

<p>"Certainly," says the harnsome critter&mdash;a smilin right in my
face again; "Shall I be your teacher, Mr. Slick?"</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I&mdash;"I'd jump down my own throat, if you on'y
told me tu."</p>

<p>With that I sot down by the table&mdash;crossed one leg a top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289] </a></span>t'other and wiped my nose. Miss Sneers, she leaned her arm on
my chair and the rest sot down.</p>

<p>"Wal, what shall we play?" sez the chap in checkered trousers.</p>

<p>"Oh, high-low-jack and the game&mdash;Mr. Slick understands
that"&mdash;sez the rest, sort a larfin. I begun to rile a trifle&mdash;"I
guess Mr. Slick knows a thing or two besides that," sez I; "he
wasn't born in the woods tu be skared at owls!" sez I.</p>

<p>They all choked in at that&mdash;one feller shuffled the cards, I cut,
and the checkered trousers took the deal. I got an allfired good
hand the first dive&mdash;ace, jack and the two spot of trumps, besides
a ten. Miss Sneers she bent over until I could feel her breath
agin my cheek, as warm and sweat as the steam from an apple-sarse
cag when the sarse is sot off to cool. I swow, it made me
feel so kinder unsettled, that the cards danced afore my eyes,
like picters run crazy. We begun to play. Miss Sneers kept a
pokin that pesky little finger of hern amongst my cards every
minute, puttin out them that I ought to play, one by one&mdash;and
afore I knew it myself, I'd beat the hull biling on 'em three
games without stoppin. Miss Sneers she seemed to be eenamost
tickled to death to think I'd done 'em up so slick, and the men
they looked streaked enough. I tell you&mdash;that one in the
checkered trousers above all. Jest as we was cuttin in for a new
deal, the doors right afore me slid back inter the wall, and there
was another room spread out afore us like a picter. It was as
light as day from one eend of the room tu t'other&mdash;and it was
enough to dazzle one's eyes to see the shiney silk tumblin down
from the golden poles over the winders&mdash;the great whoppin
lookin glasses a blazin all over that eend of the room&mdash;the carpet
kivered over and trod down with posies&mdash;the picters agin the
walls and leetle marble babies a standing round, with the candle
light a pourin down over 'em. Oh, Gosh! it was enough to
make a feller loose his breath, and never ketch it agin. There,
right in the midst of the room, was a table a shinin and a glistenin,
like a heap of ice-chunks and new half dollars piled up
together in the hot sun. The plates and the knives and forks
spoons and all, was solid silver&mdash;everything else was silver but
the glasses, and they were all pinted and pictered off, and cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290] </a></span>down in lines, till there was nothing but flash, flash, flash, wherever
the light fell, and that was strong enough; for right overhead
was another of them great gold spangles branching out
every which way, and runnin over with fire.</p>

<p>Miss Sneers she put her hand on my arm, jest so as tu let the
tip eend of her leetle finger lie agin my wrist. I swore it made
the blood tingle up my arm. We went intu the room with the
rest a follerin arter, Indian file. A great strappin nigger stood
at each side of the door-place, when we went, with white gloves
on, and towels in their hands&mdash;they bowed a'most tu the carpet
as we went by, and when we sot down, then they stood right up
on eend behind our chairs, like militia trainers jist tryin tu drill.
They lifted up the kivers from a lot of dishes, and up riz the
steam among the glasses and silver, till it seemed as if they hung
in a cloud. Oh gracious, I can't begin to tell you all that them
dishes had in 'em. There was leetle teinty tonty birds cooked
hull, claws and all&mdash;partridges with their stomachs stuffed till
they looked as pussey as cousin Jasin&mdash;squirrels a lyin there like
human babies jest baked over a trifle, and all sorts of wild varmints
that a feller ever thought of killin.</p>

<p>The niggers they dodged about, fillin plates and a handin 'em
round like lightnin. They gin Miss Sneers and I each on us a
leetle bird&mdash;darn me if I know what it was, without it was a
woodpecker stewed hull. It raly seemed tu be a shame tu stick
a fork intu the teinty varmint. I kinder diddled my knife and
fork about, till Miss Sneers got purty intimate with her bird, for
I wanted tu see if it was the fashion tu swaller 'em down in'ards
and all. She'd used her little chap purty well up, when I sot
my jaws a workin in arnest. The bird went down my throat
the quickest. It was awful sweet tastin; and the leg bones
scratched a trifle as they went down, but nothin tu speak on.</p>

<p>Wal, we laid into the squirrels and other wild critters rather
hard, till I begun tu feel a dry. There was a leetle bottle of
water stood agin each plate. I poured some out of mine, and
was a goin tu drink, but Miss Sneers, she laid her hand on the
glass, and sez she&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Slick, let me help you tu wine?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291] </a></span></p>
<p>"Not as you know on," sez I, a bowin, and a takin the tumbler
from under her hand&mdash;"I'm a teetotaler, marm, tu the back
bone!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd forgot," sez she, a lookin at her brother. He took
up a bottle with leetle chunks of sheet lead a stickin tu the neck,
and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will not refuse a glass of this cider, Mr. Slick&mdash;there's
no alcohol in this, I can tell you."</p>

<p>I was jest a goin tu say no, but Miss Sneers, she held out her
glass, and all the time that cider was a gurglin out of the bottle
and a sendin up sparkles in her glass, she kept them smilin eyes
a pourin their brightness right intu mine. When the glass was
full, she touched it tu her mouth, and gin a leetle sip, jest enough
tu make them pesky lips look a trifle damp, and redder than
ever, and sez she, a reachin the glass towards me&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must drink this, Mr. Slick."</p>

<p>I felt the blood bile intur my face agin. I kinder part reached
out my hand&mdash;then I pulled it back, and sez I&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've signed the pledge."</p>

<p>"Not agin this harmless cider," sez they altogether.</p>

<p>"Not when a lady kisses the glass," says Miss Sneers&mdash;a holdin
out the tumbler yit, and a lookin kinder anxious, as if she'd cry
right out if I didn't give up.</p>

<p>"Take it for my sake," sez she, a bendin close tu me, and a
holdin the glass right up tu my lips. They were all a lookin at
me, and kinder larfin, as if they thought I darsent take it.</p>

<p>"You see Mr. Slick will not give up the point, even tu you
Miss Sneers," sez the man with checkered trousers. "Allow me
to drain the glass your sweet lips have kissed."</p>

<p>"You be darned," sez I, a takin the cider and drinkin it down
a'most at three swallers.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" they all sung out tu once. "Here's to the ladies!"
Miss Sneers, she held out my glass agin. Her brother lifted the
bottle, and this time the cider splashed over that leetle white
hand, and come drippin over the table all the way tu my mouth.
I felt streaked about makin any more touse about a leetle cider,
and poured the glass down without squinchin. By the time I
found the bottom of that glass, I didn't feel askeared of the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292] </a></span>one the leastest might in the world. But, somehow, the more I
drank, the plates seemed to grow brighter and more unsteady.
The birds that lay yet in one of the silver dishes seemed to grow
smaller, but more on em, like young robins in a nest, when they
jest begin tu feather out. The wine decanters blazed out redder
and redder, and the cider-bottles popped and foamed like ginger-beer
in the summer time. The folks, tu, sot orful oneasy, and
somehow, the feller that sot agin me looked jest as if he'd found
a twin with checkered trousers, and a red-and-green vest, as
much like his'n as two peas in a pod.</p>

<p>I kinder seemed tu remember that Miss Sneers kept a kissin
the glasses for me, till by-am-by I sot out to do it myself, and
kissed her instead. With that, she went intu tother room. We
followed arter, and the two niggers arter us with the cider and
wine decanters in their hands.</p>

<p>"Now," sez Miss Sneers' brother sez he, "less have another
game; I'll bet Mr. Slick wont beat three times runnin agin."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he will," sez Miss Sneers, a pintin tu a seat by the
table, and a lookin good enough tu eat.</p>

<p>I sot down, and the chap in checkered trousers he begun to
shuffle away, like a house a fire.</p>

<p>Miss Sneers she bent over me agin, and her brother he sot
down and cut cards. I beat agin, right straight ahead; the hull
swad on em begun to grow kinder wamblecropped at that, and
Miss Sneers she larfed so good-natured, and bent forward so
much that her cheek a'most lay agin mine all the next game.</p>

<p>By gauly, I beat agin; and by that time, they all begun tu look
a trifle rily. The checkered trousers he took the cards and gin
em a snap along the eends that might a ben heard in the street.
With that, he slapped em down on the table, and sez he, a nodden
his head at me, sez he, "I'll bet fifty dollars you don't beat
this time." With that, he larfed till the hair on his upper lip
curled up and showed his teeth, like a dog when he snarls.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," sez Miss Sneers, "we can beat twenty such felers&mdash;you
and I, Mr. Slick, can't we?"</p>

<p>"I ruther thinks so," sez I.</p>

<p>"I'll bet fifty dollars," sez checkered trousers, "that we beat
you all hollow."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293] </a></span></p>
<p>"I'll bet you don't," sez I, a rilin up.</p>

<p>"Plank the money," sez he, a slappin the cards agin, "plank
the chink."</p>

<p>I took your old wallet from the leetle pocket in my under
vest, and unrolled the bills that I'd put there arter sellin out the
sloop load&mdash;"I spose you think I haint got it," sez I, a shakin
the harnful of bills that was left. "Hurra for old Connecticut!"
The other chaps they shell'd out, and a hull heap of bills lay on
the table. Miss Sneers she went away a minute, and then bent
over me agin, with another glass of that white cider in her hand&mdash;she
held the glass to my lips, and wouldn't take it away till
I'd drunk the hull.</p>

<p>That was prime cider, and I was a beginnin to feel dry agin,
so I drunk another glass; and at it we went, shovel and tongs.
As true as you live, they raly did beat that game; and when
they saw how wrothy I was, they offered tu bet a hundred dollars
on my luck the next time. I don't know who beat arter
that; for somehow I seemed tu be sort o' dreamin; the candles
seemed tu be a darncin round us, and it seemed as if the cards
were leetle teenty folks, all alive and a grinnin at us as we handled
em. I took out the old wallet every few minutes&mdash;I du
seem to remember that&mdash;and arter it was empty, Miss Sneer's
brother, sez he, "Never mind, my boy, we'll take your autograph."</p>

<p>"I don't keep any such new-fangled varmints," sez I.</p>

<p>"Oh, on'y jest write your name here," sez he, a handin over
a strip of paper.</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez I, a takin the pen he held out; "jest so, but
good gauly, du hold the paper still. I can't ketch up with it if
it moves about the table this way."</p>

<p>"It's your hand," sez he.</p>

<p>"My hand!" sez I&mdash;"you git out!"</p>

<p>I gin a dive at the paper and held it kinder still, while I did
up a long tailed J. I had tu begin agin at the S, but arter a dive
or tu, I curlecued it up about right, and then we went tu playin
cards agin. They seemed tu take a great shine tu my name that
night, and kept a askin me for it every few minutes, till I went
away. I don't jest know when Miss Sneers went away, or exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294] </a></span>how I got away myself; but the next morning I woke up in
my bunk with the darndest head ache that I ever dreamed on.
Captin Doolittle he sot in the cabin a lookin at me, and a cryin
like a great baby.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Captin?" sez I, a turnin over.</p>

<p>"Jonathan," sez he, a risin from the locker, and diggin both
hands in his old trousers pocket, "Jonathan, its time for us tu
haul up stakes and go hum."</p>

<p>The tears run down the old chap's face, as he said this, and he
turned his face away that I shouldn't see them.</p>

<p>I tried tu think of what had turned up tu make the captin
take on so. My head beat like a drum&mdash;I partly remembered
the cider, the cards and Miss Sneers. I looked at Captin Doolittle;
he had the poor old empty wallet in his hands, and I could
see the tears drop into it.</p>

<p>I lay down agin, kivered my face with the piller, and burst
out a cryin.</p>

<p>I guess I lay still a cryin like a baby as much as ten minutes
and there sot Captin Doolittle a holdin the empty wallet all the
time. At last I sot up an eend and looked at the captin as well
as I dare, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Captin what shall I du?"</p>

<p>The Captin he looked up, and sez he,</p>

<p>"Jonathan you'd better fust tell me jest what you have done
a'ready." I sot to as well as I could and told him the hull story
about Miss Sneers, the theatre, playing cards, the bird supper,
and the cider. When I'd got through he shook his head sort of
mournful, and sez he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jonathan, this is a bad business; you've made a shote of
yourself and gambled all your father's money away; it's eenamost
as bad as stealen."</p>

<p>"Oh don't say that are," sez I, a kiverin my face with both
hands. "I feel bad enough without bein twitted of what I've
done, gracious knows?"</p>

<p>"Wal, I know it aint generous tu strike a feller when he's
down," sez the captin, "but what is to be done? That's the
question."</p>

<p>"Wal," sez the Captin, "supposin you put on your things and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295] </a></span>we'll go up to that consarned gamblin hole and see if any thing
can be done to git the money back. I hain't no doubt but that
Miss Sneers will be tickled tu death tu see you agin."</p>

<p>I got up and dressed myself as well as I could for my head
ached as if it would crack open. The Captin he was as good as
any thing; he poured a hull pitcher full of cold water over my
hair, and arter making me drink a strong cup of tea, I felt kinder
better about the head, but oh Lord a massy, how my heart
ached!</p>

<p>I felt so down in the mouth that I couldn't talk, so we both
started off towards that consarned house agin.</p>

<p>"Now Jonathan," sez the Captin, as we got agin the steps,
"it goes agin the grain tu say so, but you jest make believe that
I am a police officer, and keep a stiff upper lip, ring the bell and
walk right in; I'll come arter and we'll du their bisness for em
in less than no time."</p>

<p>I rung the bell.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Sneers tu hum?" sez I.</p>

<p>"No," sez he, as quick as lightning, "she went into the country
this morning."</p>

<p>I was a going tu say that I'd seen her, when Captin Doolittle
pushed right by and giving the nigger a shove on one side, sez he,</p>

<p>"Walk in, Jonathan, walk in and make yourself tu hum."
With that he dove into the hall and I arter him&mdash;he opened the
side door into the room we were in the night before, and gin a
peak round.</p>

<p>"Nobody there," sez he, "go up stairs, I'll settle the nigger if
he gets obstropulous, and then follow arter."</p>

<p>I went right up stairs, and was jest a knocking at the door of
Miss Sneers' room, when I see that it was open a trifle; and as
I gin a peak through, there was the chap that she called her
brother shying out through the eend door&mdash;I jest gin a knock
that sent the door a flyin open, and went in. Miss Sneers was
settin on that silken bench, dressed out in a ruffled white frock,
and with her hair twisted back in a hurry, and kinder tousled
up with a gold chain in it, as if she hadn't touched it since the
night afore. She jumped half up when she see me, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296] </a></span>settled down agin with her lips shet tight together, and a lookin
hard in my eyes as if uncertain who it was.</p>

<p>I walked right up to her and held out my hand, "How do you
du this morning, Miss Sneers," sez I.</p>

<p>She kinder leaned back, and lookin right straight in my eyes,
sez she,</p>

<p>"You must have mistook the room, sir, I do not usually receive
company here."</p>

<p>I swow, it seemed as if the critter had swallered a chunk of
ice, she spoke so stiff and cold. I looked around the room a
minit, and then I turned tu her agin, and sez I,</p>

<p>"Look a here marm, you don't seem tu be over tickled tu see
me this morning, so I'll make myself scarce the minit you'll give
me a chance tu see that brother of yourn."</p>

<p>"You are laborin under another mistake," sez she, as frosty as
ever. "My brother is not in the house."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll tell me by-am-by that I mustn't believe my
own eyes," sez I a getting wrothy. "Jest ask that mean shote
to come out of the other room there&mdash;I saw him sneak off with
my own eyes not three minutes ago."</p>

<p>She turned a trifle red when I talked up to her so, and arter
chokin a second, sez she, as cool as a cowcumber, sez she,</p>

<p>"Not my brother, you did not see my brother, he is my husband,
sir."</p>

<p>I felt the blood bile in my veins and my face seemed afire.
"Your husband marm?" sez I, a getting up a laugh that eended
off in a savage grin, "and so you're, you're,"&mdash;</p>

<p>"His wife sir," sez she, with a cold tarntalisin smile, "and
now, as I am particularly engaged, perhaps you will leave the
house."</p>

<p>"Not jest yet," sez Captin Doolittle, a bolting intu the room.
"We've got some business with that husband of your'n, marm."</p>

<p>"And who are you sir?" sez the woman a turnin white as
curd and sittin down half scared tu death.</p>

<p>"I don't know as that is any consarn of your'n," sez he, a
hauling a piece of paper folded up square from his pocket. "I
want that swindlin scamp that you call husband, and its my
opinion that he and I get better acquainted afore I leave these
ere premises."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297] </a></span></p>
<p>I never see a poor critter wilt down as she did, her face was
as white as snow, so was her mouth, and I could see it begin tu
tremble all she could du to help it.</p>

<p>"Surely, surely, you havn't brought a police officer here?" sez
she, a lookin at me, and them soft eyes of her'n were a swimmin
in tears. I begun to relent.</p>

<p>"Jonathan, don't make a coot of yourself," sez the Captin, a
givin me a sly poke in the ribs; then he went right up tu her,
and sez he,</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you're surprised marm, it aint often that you
get a decent chap like me in this nest of varmints, but when one
on us du come we generally make purty clean work of it, I can
tell you that! Perhaps your husband won't be the only one that
will get hauled over the coals. I've seen purtyer women than
you are afore the police magistrates afore now."</p>

<p>The critter began tu tremble and looked at me as pitiful as a
rabbit in a trap.</p>

<p>"It ain't of no use," sez Captin Doolittle a pushin me back,
"salt won't save you if that scamp of your'n don't shell out.
Mr. Slick here haint nothin to du with the bisness now that he's
gin it up tu the law. You haint got sich a mealy hearted chap
as him to deal with, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"But what du you want?" sez she, a shakin as if she was a
cold.</p>

<p>"I want the money you swindled out of this young feller las
night," sez he. "The money and the notes you made him give
and by the living hokey if it aint handed over in less than ten
minutes, I'll have every darned varmint in the house marched
off tu the tombs."</p>

<p>The poor critter grew wuss and wuss; after a minute she
turned to me and sez she, a sobbin like all natur,</p>

<p>"So you've indicted the house, have you?"</p>

<p>I didn't just know what she meant, and the Captin seemed as
bad off, but he gin me a poke to keep still, and sez he, "You'll
find out I reckon, but as that are husband of yourn seems loth tu
come out I'll jest give him a little invite." With that he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298] </a></span>into t'other room and arter a little noise of scuffling cum out
agin a leadin the woman's brother or husband by the ear. He
had taken an orful hard grip, and the critter's souse looked as
red as if it had just been scalded.</p>

<p>"Are you a goin to shell out or not?" sez the Captin. The
feller gin a pull, and the Captin follered suit, which stretched
his ear rather more than he seemed to relish.</p>

<p>"Come, we're in something of a hurry," sez the Captin,
"we'd jist as leave have you as the money."</p>

<p>The feller gin his head a jerk, but the Captin's fingers made a
fust rate vice, and the old feller put on the screws tight enough.</p>

<p>"Jake, Jake!" the feller yelled out.</p>

<p>"If your nigger's name is Jake I'm afeared he won't hear,"
sez the Captin a puttin a chaw of tobaccer intur his mouth with
one hand, while he gin the ear an extra pinch with the other.
"I locked him up in a pantry down stairs, plenty of wine bottles
there, he's comfortable enough, don't disturb the poor nigger now,
don't."</p>

<p>The feller gin the Captin's side a dig with his fist; with that
the Captin jest gin him a jerk towards the door, and sez he, a
turning tu me as cool as get out, sez he, "call the rest on em up
Mr. Slick, I can du this feller's business; but the lady there may
want two beaus agin&mdash;call 'em up."</p>

<p>I really felt sorry for the poor woman, she jumped up and
flung her arms around the chap, and sez she,</p>

<p>"Du give it up, du, I cannot bear this, they will do it, you see
they will."</p>

<p>"Tell him to let go my ear," sez the feller a turning his tarnal
white face tu mine, "and I'll give you the money, provided you
don't molest us agin."'</p>

<p>"Jest so," sez the Captin, undoing his grip, "shell out, shell
out."</p>

<p>The feller put his hand in his pocket and hauled out a swad of
bills and five slips of paper with my name on em, all rumpled up
together.</p>

<p>"Jest see tu him," sez the Captin, a nodden his head towards
the chap, "while I see if it's all right." So he sot down on the
silk settee close by that poor woman, and histing one leg over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299] </a></span>tother, spit on his fingers and counted over the money. It was
all fair, so he rolled it up in a swad, put it intu the old wallet and
handed it over to me.</p>

<p>"There," sez he, "Mr. Slick, I spose we may as well be a
joggin."</p>

<p>With that he told the chap that he'd find the key in the closet
door and the nigger safe, and we went down.</p>

<p>"There Jonathan," sez the Captin, "I rather guess we've
done it! But what makes you look so womblecroped?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," sez I, a brushin my hands across my eyes,
"but it seems tu me that I've lost something more than all that
money's worth."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" sez he.</p>

<p>"It's the fust time on earth that I could believe that women
could raly be so deceitful and bad. I feel as though I never
should think so well of them agin&mdash;as if a part of my own heart
had dried up all tu once. Captin, Captin, I'd rather work night
and day for the money than feel so lonesome about the heart as
I do now; I'd as lives stay in a world without sun, as to have no
sartinty in the truth of women folks."</p>

<p class="salutation">I remain your humble, but loving son,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
